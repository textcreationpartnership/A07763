            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">Rom. 9</note> I lie not, my conſcience beareth me witneſſe by the holy Ghoſt, that I haue great heauines of hart, that I could wiſh my ſelf accurſed, &amp; to be ſeparated from Chriſt for your ſakes. <hi>This that great Apoſtle, notwithſtanding who would not know any thing for all, but Chriſt, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be ſeparated from all the world, yea and ſeparated in himſelfe, to bee with Chriſt: and therefore verilie for ſome exceeding great and important cauſe: as, for to ſee them drawne out of the wayes of deſtruction, into the ſtate of ſaluation: that is to ſay, coupled and vnited to Chriſt: And therefore it is moſt euident that hee iudged them loſt, in that estate wherein they were, in aſmuch as they coulde not bee founde in Chriſt, and ſo without ſaluation, for that they were without Chriſts. They neuertheleſſe (ſayth hee)</hi> to whome belonged the adoption, and the glorie, and the couenants, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the law, and the diuine ſeruice, and the promiſes: of whome came the fathers, and of whom according to the fleſh came Chriſt? <hi>And yet notwithſtanding all this, he letteth not to declare them</hi> to be of Iſrael, and yet not Iſrael: to be the ſeed of Abraham, yet notwithſtanding not all children, becauſe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the worde of God cannot fall away, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May I here my maſters be ſo bolde, as to ſay the like vnto you? In reſpect of my ſelfe verily I may not. I deſire your ſaluation with a great affection: I wiſh it heartilie, with the hazard of this my life: yea I will ſay in a good conſcience, as the ſaide Apoſtle ſaide vnto Agrippa:</hi> That it might pleaſe God to make you all ſuch like as <hi>I</hi> my ſelfe, except theſe bondes: <hi>except thoſe afflictions, whereunto this profeſsion is ſubiect. For what is more, belongeth not to any man beſides the Apoſtle, in whome the exceeding meaſure of knowledge begot an exceeding meaſure of loue towards God, and charitie towards his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which as we cannot imitate in effect: ſo neither muſt we in worde: beſides that this hyperbolicall kinde of ſpeech, can hardly fit vs. But rather in reſpect of you, I dare be bold to ſay more: for the couenants and ordinances of the lawe, and the diuine ſeruice, and the promiſes, were giuen vnto you long ago: but not vnto you alone, but not to you more then others. And many fathers are ſprung vp amongſt you, and you it may be diſcended of them, according to the fleſh: but yet for all this, the worde of God cannot fall away or periſh, no not although Chriſt himſelfe, who is God bleſſed aboue all things, ſhould be deſcended of you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh. That word verily which giueth vs to vnderſtande, that there muſt fall out an apoſtacie in the Church, that the man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition, ſhould ſit in the Temple of God, cauſing himſelfe to be adored therein as God. And ſeeing you cleaue vnto him vnder the ſhadow of this See, of this pretended diſcent, I dare bee bolde to ſay vnto you freely with the Apoſtle: Deceiue not your ſelues with thinking your ſelues to be the children
<pb facs="tcp:15548:4"/>of Abraham, for you are not children at all,</hi> ſuch as are of the faith, <hi>and not of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galat. 3.7. Rom. 9.8.</note> are Abrahams children, for they are the children of the promiſe, they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily are reputed for the ſeede.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is queſtion then about this faith,
<note place="margin">In controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies we muſt haue recourſe to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and euerie man ſaith that he hath it. To know of what ſide Chriſt is, and euery man betaketh himſelfe to him as his ayde, and thereupon all Chriſtendome liueth in ſuſpence and doubt, or in trouble. But, my brethren, let vs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue men: Men, ſaith our Lord himſelfe, who know not of their owne vnderſtanding, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence he commeth, or whether he goeth: The ſpirits of men, ſaith the ſpirit of God, which are not able to comprehend his wayes. In a Sea ſo vnknowne to man, in theſe gulfes ſo perillous, we cannot attaine to the deliuering of any ſure and certaine ſpeech from other where then God himſelfe: from the father, who hath ſpoken from heauen, ſhewed vs the ſonne,

How farre better, ſaith Saint Bernard, ſpeaking of the reformation neceſſarie in the Church:</hi> Let them be caſt behinde both me and you, which ſay, we will not liue better then our fathers. <hi>If of the ſpirituall, as of thoſe that haue begotten vs to Chriſt: then who are they, but the Apoſtles, and the holie fathers that followed them? And what ſay we herein, but by their mouthes? And who is there to leade vs more from cuſtomes, to the lawe, from traditions to the holie Scriptures?

And if, to be briefe, a Church forſake the faith, it behooueth vs to forſake and abandon it, &amp;c. <hi>And he yeeldeth a reaſon:</hi> Chriſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is the rocke:

<note place="margin">To agree of the bookes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Canonical.</note> of the ſetting downe of the ſpirit of God for iudge, rightlie diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed from euerie ſpirit of man: for humane ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after the maner of monie, is ſo much the more hurtfull and damnable, by how much the coine that it hath counterfeited is the better: and hereof the olde Church hath had a ſpeciall regard.

To take vpon him to make any lawes therein of himſelfe, this is to coine money this is to incroch vpon the Prince, he cannot doe it without committing of treaſon, yea without the incurring of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.

In whom we muſt conſider what they haue ſaid, not in that they haue ſaid it, but in that they haue ſaid it by the way of expounding of the Scripture; not ſpeaking of their owne heades, but according to their capacitie of the ſenſe and meaning thereof. As for example, we reaſon of purgatorie: The queſtion here is not to know, if it be to be found in Origen, Auguſtine, or S.

If it belong to vs to know it, let God haue reuealed and diſcloſed it vnto vs, for it is not to be learned at the geſſe of any of the Fathers: let vs then haue found it in the Church her treaſurie, the Scripture.

For the ſtile of the Epiſtles attributed to the firſt Biſhops of Rome, is meerely barbarous and Gottiſh, in the times of the greateſt flouriſhing of the Latine tongue: and when there could not bee found in all Italie, nor in all the Romane Empire, either learned or idiot, that could ſpeake this language: The ſtile of Denys the pretended Areoopagite, is nothing like to Saint Pauls, containing nothing of Apoſtolicall note or marke, nothing of the ſpoiling of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſo oft repeated by the Apoſtle: The treatiſe of Sina and Sion againſt the Iewes, &amp;c. nothing of that vigor which was in Saint Cyprian his other writings againſt the very ſame, but farre leſſe of his elegancie, zeale, and doctrine: The pretended Canons alſo of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, how ſhould they proceed from them, when they forbid that which the others approue? and command that which they do openly diſproue and diſallow?

And let this bee ſaide for no other ende, then of manie to giue an example in ſome few particulars of the curſed practiſes that Sathan hath continued in the Church, for the bringing in of his errours, vnder the name of the moſt approoued Teachers. And this veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie not newe or ſtraunge, ſeeing that euen preſently after the life time of the Apoſtles, if Saint Iohn, who ouerliued them, had not prouided againſt it, he had fathered ſome vpon Saint Paule, Saint Peter, and certaine others, and thoſe alſo of the peregrination of Saint Paul and Thecla; which our aduerſaries at this day labour to raiſe againe out of the graue, and to ſet in their former liuelihood and credite.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The third is; That we marke diligently if the father or ancient Doctor which we handle,
<note place="margin">To conſider well if ſuch father haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a good tranſlation.</note> haue followed a ſound tranſlation, haue well vnderſtood the words and phraſe of the Text in controuerſie or not: for, for example, what apparance is there, that the Commentaries of S. Hillarie, or of S. Gregorie vpon Iob: of S. Ambroſe, S. Auguſtine, or S. Bernard vpon the Pſalmes, can alwaies reach vnto the ſenſe and meaning, when they haue vſed a tranſlation, wherein there are almoſt as many faults as words? That S. Anſelme, or S.
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> Bernard ſhould be able to gather good doctrine from that place, in the tranſlation of Geneſis;</hi> Ipſa conteret ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Serpentis, the woman, <hi>and not Chriſt</hi> ſhall breake the Serpents head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Or out of that other, Gen.</hi> 4. Quam vt veniam merear: <hi>from whence our aduerſaries gather the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of merit? There where it is:</hi> My puniſhment is greater then that I can beare. <hi>Whereas then we ſhall find that a Father ſhall haue followed a falſe tranſlation, we ſhall not poſsiblie be able to come by a true expoſition: ſo that in ſuch caſe, we are to preferre and make more account of the leaſt, that ſhall haue had it right, then him who ſhall haue followed the falſe, following the precept which they themſelues did giue vs here tofore:</hi> That we are not to reſt vpon the Latine tranſlation, but to haue recourſe vnto the originall and fountaine, whether Hebrew or Greeke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now behold the fourth, which is, that when we are once agreed of the literall ſenſe, we ſhould weigh the expoſitions of the Fathers the Interpreters, both in the ballance of the
<pb facs="tcp:15548:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>Scripture, and in the analogie of faith: reſpect their pietie, doctrine, and time wherein they liue, and receiue their opinions with reuerence: whether they ſhall be differing, or agreeing in one, or ariſing from diuerſe and ſundrie perſons; let vs preferre that which is ſpoken in handling the place of purpoſe, before that which is ſpoken in touching of it by the waye: that which is ſaide in teaching familiarly, before that which may bee ſpoken rhetoricallie, as it ſomtimes falleth out in preaching: that which is ſpoken affirmatiuely, before that which is ſpoken doubtfully: that which is ſpoken from the proper ſenſe of the Authour, before that which is ſpoken by imitating of another: that which is gathered from the literall ſenſe, before that which is drawne from ſome allegoricall ſenſe, which proueth not: and aboue all, that which is ſpoken of ſome place in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, before the controuerſie riſe, at ſuch time as there is nothing ſought after therein but the ſimple truth, yea or otherwiſe after it hath beene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, when as we ſhall haue ſearched out thereof, for the fortifying of our opinion. Here alſo will occaſion be adminiſtred, to put difference betwixt the Fathers, according to the degree and qualitie that their doctrine and pure life hath aduaunced them vnto in the Church: for there is ſome ſuch a one that is worth manie, according to their times; according, I ſay, as they haue beene nearer, or further off from the true light, ſeeing that Saint Ierome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth himſelfe,
<note place="margin">S. Auguſt. ad Ianuarium. Bed. l. 4. in Sam. c. 2.</note> that he was in his time come vnto the lees. Saint Auguſtine;</hi> That all was now become full of preſumptions, preiudicate opinions, and more then Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall Ceremonies. <hi>Beda likewiſe:</hi> That it was a lamentable thing, and not to bee vttered without teares, how that in his time the Church grewe worſe and worſe euery day. <hi>And this will proue true in counting cleane contrarie to our Ieſuites: for they to caſt duſt in the eyes of the world doe tell vs: Such a one who liued</hi> 800. <hi>or</hi> 1000. <hi>yeares ſince, hath ſaid this or that: whereas they ſhould ſay, ſuch a one who liued</hi> 200. 300. <hi>or</hi> 400. <hi>yeares next after the Apoſtles, hath ſpoken thus, &amp;c. For our queſtion is not how long time a lie hath indured.</hi> The diuell <hi>(ſaith the Lord,)</hi> is a liar from the beginning: <hi>but what manner of doctrine that was which was firſt, that is according to Tertullian the truth, then, when, how, &amp; by what degrees, falſehood and lying ſprung vp, increaſed and grew great, &amp; aduaunced it ſelfe againſt,
<note place="margin">Vincent. Lyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſ. c. 39.</note> and aboue this truth, &amp;c. And this is that which Lyrinenſis ſaith:</hi> For the expounding of the Canonicall Scripture, we muſt ſummon and call togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the aduiſes of the fathers, but preferre that euermore which they haue ſpoken, either all or the greateſt part of them, and that verie manifeſtly, often, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, aſſuredly, &amp;c. what hath beene otherwiſe deliuered, what Saint, Martyr, or Teacher ſoeuer he hath beene, let vs hold it, inter proprias &amp; occultas, &amp; priuatas opiniunculas, for Apocrypha and priuate opinions.</p>

               <note place="margin">Auguſt. Epiſt. 166.</note> We haue learned Chriſt in the Scriptures, as alſo wee haue there learned the Church: <hi>I dare alſo here ſay vnto you my maſters; therein wee ſhall take knowledge of Antichrist; therein ſhall we obſerue the corruption that hee hath brought into the Church: The corruption: for it ſerueth not any more either for ſeed graine, or graſſe, as ſometimes: The darnell &amp; good Corne alike perhaps, vntil the time of earing, would be able to deceiue vs a little; but growne into flower, and being come to their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that filleth with the ſtench of the ſmell, and poyſoneth with his vapour, all ſuch as ſhould ſtand a farre off: And euen ſo Antichriſt; for there is no more any queſtion of a ſtarre, to conduct and guide vs to him; of ſeeking of him in a Manger, in his ſwathing band, or in his firſt infancie:</hi> As at ſuch rime <hi>(ſaith S. Paul)</hi> as iniquitie began but to worke. <hi>For to make vs all inexcuſable, the day of the Lord is come to his full height: He is ſeated vpon ſeuen mountaines; incamped in the Temple of God, extolling himſelfe aboue God, extolling himſelfe againſt God; working with all the efficacie of Sathan, in all powerfulneſſe and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of lying; making drunke with his Cup, the Kings and Princes of the earth; opening his mouth in blaſphemies againſt the higheſt, againſt his Chriſt, and vnder the name of Chriſt.

To you then my Maſters vpon whome the last times are come, it belongeth to take knowledge of him; either by the pourtraiture which yee haue of him in the Scripture, or by his working which you ſee in the Church; or by his words, or by his workes. For then you ſhall not haue to ſay vnto vs any more: Who are you that declare him vnto vs? Where are your Commiſsions? Where are your Bulles? Theſe are the petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foggeries of the Court of Rome. It is ſaid: that the Sonne of perdition ſhall cauſe a great Apoſtaſie: Either we muſt turne with thoſe of the Apoſtaſie, or proteſt againſt it.

But the queſtion is of Traditions, which haue inſinuated themſelues, and are ſprung vppe together with the time by the induſtrie of men, and that to the choaking of the true plantes of Chriſtes fielde. Of Traditions, which by the reading of Antiquities, wee ſee and behold firſt in the bare and naked ſeede, then in the bud putting forth, growing and riſing vp into a ſtalke, bearing fruite, ouergrowing in the end the good corne, ouerſpreading the earth, watred with the vanitie and ordinarie curioſitie of men, manured and fed with the ignorance of the moſt darke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſhadowed ages. Of Traditions, one marke or ſtep whereof, for the moſt part we cannot eſpie or finde out eyther in the holie Scriptures, or in the Primitiue church: but which from age to age we finde and ſee to haue ſprung vp of ſome croſſe or ouertwhart word, or elſe of ſome vnexpected action, as hearbes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by chance, &amp; wherof there is no great regard or reckoning made: or elſe to grow by a priuation, or negatiuelie in ſome doubtfull queſtion, from thence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into ſome affirmatiue not well and firmelie grounded, and finally ending in a full and abſolute concluſion, from whence is drawne within ſome ſpace of time after, and ſo throughout euerie age, ſuch ſtrange increaſe and ouerrunning meaſure, ſuch conſequences ſo far differing from the firſt ſteps and footinges, as that they which firſt caſt the ſeede into the grounde, not thinking of any ſuch harueſt, would not bee able (as it falleth out with the fowles of the aire, letting fall ſome nut or acorn) euer to auouch the ſame for theirs, if they ſhould returne to beholde them, yea which would rather haue ſmothered and ſtifled them in the birth, if they had foreſeen anie ſhew of ſuch monſtrouſnes to haue euſued. And finallie of Traditions, which ſmoothlie conuey themſelues vnder the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of indifferencie, and a certaine kinde of pretended ſeemlines into thercome
<pb facs="tcp:15548:17"/>and place of profite, of neceſſitie of ſubiection (yea and that greater then any Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall ſeruitude) and of the Articles of faith: Articles I call them, ſeeing that men now a dayes (ſuch as are our aduerſaries,) are farre more tenderlie affected and deeplier doting vpon their owne inuentions, then vpon faith it ſelfe. And for the which they let not to ſtand and contend a great deale more in the church of Rome, to maintain the ſame, then they do ſtriue and ſeeke to root out Atheiſme, notwithſtanding it iet vp and downe like a Lord, and ſpreade it ſelfe into euerie coaſt and quarter vnder the name of Philoſophie, priuilie vndermining, and thereupon forciblie ouerturning the foundations of the church of Chriſt, the holie Scriptures, and the holie Sacramentes. Articles againe, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof they are not aſhamed, to weaken ſo much as lieth in them the force and authoritie of Gods word: and for the procuring of authority thereunto, they defend the ſufficiencie, integritie and ſimplicitie of the ſame, they make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to call the miniſterie of death the miniſtery of our life, and to pronounce as imperfect and vnſufficient vnto Saluation the Scriptures, whereof the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worde did ſay vnto the Iewes (and then by a ſtronger reaſon to vs:) <hi>Examine the Scriptures diligentlie and carefullie, for you thinke to haue eternall life by them: and they are thoſe that beare witnes of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it were no hard or difficult matter to demonſtrate and ſhew foorth the ſame throughout all the Articles which are in controuerſie, and indeede the matter hath beene performed by diuerſe alreadie. But I will reſt my ſelfe for this time in ſhewing the truth thereof, in the matter of the Maſſe, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances thereof: becauſe at this day it occupieth the principall place of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice in the church of Rome: becauſe it ſeemeth vnto them the badge &amp; cognizance to diſtinguiſh betwixt the good and euill Chriſtian: becauſe that in not going thereunto, or in going thereunto, is (as they hold in their opinion) to worke a mans damnation or ſaluation: And laſtly, becauſe that it containing &amp; compriſing in it, eyther the doctrine or the practiſe of the principall pointes which are in controuerſie betwixt vs, it ſhall ſtand for a full reuew of the whole bodie of their religion, or not want much thereof, if it bee throughlie examined and ſifted. If then it be of ſuch moment and importance vnto ſaluation, as they would make vs belieue, we need not to doubt anie thing at all, but that we ſhall finde it ſo moſt clearelie and euidentlie by the holy Scriptures: as alſo that wee ſhall bee able to deriue it from the firſt and pureſt ages, wherein the ſacred foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of mans ſaluation continued and ſtood in his vnſpotted puritie and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite bringhtnes, not hauing beene as yet troubled with our humaine inuentions, not hauing been as yet defiled with the ſuperſtitions which the prepoſterous i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitarion of Iudaiſme, or the vnaduiſed skill of faſhioning themſelues after the manner of the Gentiles, did together with the time, draw in huge and maſſie heapes vpon them. For otherwiſe certainely if we can neither become acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it by the holie Scriptures, nor finde out anie markes or tokens of the ſame to haue beene vſed in all that ſpace of pure and vncorrupted Antiquitie; but rather that not ſo much as the name thereof is therein ſpecified, and that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeruice was then offered vp to God: let vs bee bolde to ſay, that then the miſterie and price of our Saluation lyeth not therein, ſeeing that Saluation it ſelf hath not inſtituted or ordayned the ſame: as alſo that the Seruice to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the church, doth not conſiſt therein, ſeeing the Primitiue church did neuer know it. But then may we well ſee and perceiue, that it is ſome baſtardly
<pb facs="tcp:15548:18"/>broode and intire and vniuerſall corrupting of Chriſt his inſtitution, and of the firſt and auncient manner of ſeruing of God, tranſformed and changed by little &amp; little from an abuſe of words, into an abuſe of matter and ſubſtance, from a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to a ſacrifice, and from a ſacrifice euchariſticall, to a propitiatorie ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and from the commemoration or remembrance of the onely ſacrifice of Chriſt, into a pretended reall and dayly killing and offering vp of himſelfe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that this ſaide Maſſe which we ſee now a dayes is nothing elſe but a collection and patched thing of many ages, &amp; a compoſition incorporated by many Popes, for the more preciſenes whereof, there haue not beene admitted thereunto anie other ingredientes from time to time, then the abuſes which Sathan, men and the iniquitie of time, haue beene able to bring in, eyther of pretended malice, or through careleſſe negligence, or through ignorance into the church. In ſo much as that finallie, the holie Supper of our Lord, cannot there retaine anie thing to be knowne by, neyther hath it anie thing ſo contrarie, oppoſite or repugnant, as the Maſſe: which from this lawfull and legitimate iſſue (as ſome of the old Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue called it,) is changed into an illegitimare and baſtardly thing, from a publique into a priuate, from the communion of the faithfull in the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, into a particular celebration by one prieſt, and (to be briefe) from a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of the death of our Lord, into a colde and ridiculous repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, from a real and effectual participation of that fleſh, giuen for the life of the world, and of that bloode ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, into a dumbe and doltiſh ceremonie, and that to be therewithall ſuch a ceremonie, as which aſſiſting &amp; aiding vs (a thing neuer heard of in any of the former times) there is more hope and helpe to be expected. I ſay not then from the holie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, adminiſtred according to his inſtitution, nor then from all the Sacramentes of the Church of Chriſt: but then from the verie ſacrifice which the Lord hath once offered vppon the tree of the Croſſe, for the ſaluation of mankinde.</p>
            <p>Now therefore for the clearer handling of this matter, I will diuide this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe into foure partes. The firſt ſhall bee of the originall and proceeding of the Maſſe according to all the partes thereof, and the ſecond of the circumſtances, &amp; whatſoeuer is depending thereupon, which is all that which properlie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the hiſtorie thereof. The third ſhall declare how it is to be conſidered and tried according to the nature and quality of a ſacrifice: and the fourth, how in the nature and qualitie of a ſacrament: being that which commeth neereſt to the touching of the doctrine thereof. And I beſeech all thoſe that loue the truth, and are feruentlie touched with an earneſt care of their owne ſaluation, that they would open their eyes, and bring them to the ſight and view of this matter, clean and purged from all manner of preiudice, of whatſoeuer foreſtalled opinion: as likewiſe I pray God that he would giue me the grace of comming vnto this work with a true and ſincere affection and vnfained defire to ſee the church of Chriſte reformed according vnto true antiquitie in theſe our daies, &amp; purged from al no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, which degenerate from the ſame, reformed according vnto that antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I ſay, which hath for his foundation the doctrine of the Sonne of God, &amp; the practiſe of his Apoſtles gouerned by his ſpirite, but purged from that noueltie which can alledge nothing for his maintenance, but the dreams of men, &amp; thoſe, ſuch as are alwaies younglings and babes in things concerning God, yea rather alwaies brutiſh (as ſayeth S. Paul) in that which concerneth his ſeruice.</p>

               <p>And now we haue to conſider, what it is that the Maſſe hath common, and what it hath like, with this holy Supper at this day; this holy Supper I ſay, wherein wee ſee that our Lord, the Lord of the Sabbath, the Lord of all the ceremonies, the Lord of the law it ſelfe, did not diſdaine exactly to obſerue all the circumſtances of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of the ſame as they are ordained in the law, as namely the day, the houre, and the manner and forme there preſcribed, referring the ſame to his true and proper vſe onely, and to the onely end it reſpected, which was himſelfe pointed out &amp; prefigured in the ſame. Whereas they of the Church of Rome, men &amp; ſinners (as all the kind of man is) haue not beene aſhamed to diſpenſe with the inſtitution of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to cut and clip it, change and alter it after all, after their owne beſt liking &amp; faſhion. Our Lord diſtributed the bread and the cup vnto his Apoſtles, the maiſter of the houſhold vnto his children: where is there any one ſtep or marke of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, of this communicating in the Maſſe?

Aſſuredly if theſe Maſſes riſe from ſuch authors as are the Apoſtles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts, there is cauſe for vs to yeeld &amp; ſtoope: for they were gouerned by the holy Ghoſt; and the holy Ghoſt is alwaies, like himſelfe, and ſo by conſequent it muſt follow, that wee giue vnto them the honour which wee vſe to giue vnto their Epiſtles and Goſpels.

And that the rather in good ſooth, for that it is our dutie, (for that teſtimonie ſake which we do owe vnto the truth) to make our ſelues parties againſt them, and that the more by reaſon of the horrible hugenes of deceiuing lies, ſo impudently broached in the matters concerning our ſaluation.</p>

Iudge what apparance of truth is in theſe aſſertions, when as S.

                  <hi>ſhew mercie Lord,</hi> a little child in the ſight of the people and of the Patriarke Proclus, was rauiſhed and carried vp into heauen for the ſpace of an houre, where he learned this Hymne: and comming downe againe, taught the ſame vnto the people, who ſinging the ſame, the earthquake ceaſed. And hereupon it came, that this was receyued of the Church into the beadroule of holy Hymnes, and ratified by the Councell of Calcedon. For this Felix the third liued aboute the yeare 480. the Patriarke Proclus about the yeare 460. and this is that Proclus, whome they obtrude vnto vs for a ſpeciall witnes concerning this Lithurgie. And can it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15548:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>come to paſſe that this Hymne falling out vpon this miracle, coulde not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued into the Church til neare fiue hundred years after our Lord, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be found placed, &amp; that in the ſame place that it is vſually ſet in in others in this Lithurgie? But let vs go forward. There was publike prayers made for them which were in the Monaſteries. At this time nor yet for three hundred years after, were there anie Monkes in Syria, that is to ſay, in the countrie where Ieruſalem is ſcituate, much leſſe were they then in Monaſteries.
<note place="margin">S. Hieronim. in vita Hilar.</note> S. Ierome a witnes of that aſſemby in the place aboue mentioned, <hi>they did run</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>with emulation from Syria and Egypt to Hilario in ſuch ſort as that manie belieued in Chriſt, and became Monks: for at that time as yet there were no Monaſteries in Paleſtina, neyther yet did anie know in Syria what they meant, &amp; there was Hillario, the firſt founder and ordayner of this kind of life and conuerſation: he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, that he would giue vs to find grace with the Apoſtles, Martyrs and Confeſſors.</hi> But where is read the name Confeſſors,
<note place="margin">Bellarminde miſſa. lib. 2. cap. 20.</note> but of a long time after? And for their better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction I wold haue them yet at the leaſt to belieue Bellarmin, who would proue the antiquitie of the Romaine Canon, becauſe it is not mentioned in that place: <hi>In aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>as the name of Confeſſors was not admitted into the prayers of the church, til after long time, euen a little before Charles the great,</hi> He bringeth in <hi>Temples, Altars, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of incenſe, and making of cenſors,</hi> In a time wherein euerie man knoweth, that no man ſpeaketh of anie thing but perſecution, and priuate prayers in houſes and caues, and who knoweth not how manie ages were expired, and ſpent before euer it grew to that heade? But O intollerable blaſphemie. <hi>He offered incenſe vnto God:</hi> He offered it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame tearmes, as it ſeemeth to him that hee offered his owne ſonne, as with the ſame faith and with the ſame hope. <hi>Receiue</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>at the handes of vs ſinners this offring of incenſe for a ſauour of a ſweet ſmel, for the remiſsion of our ſinnes, and the ſins of all thy people &amp;c.</hi> and this he repeateth againe afterward without changing anie thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, when hee bleſſeth and preſenteth the Sacramentes. How will this agree with the doctrine of the Apoſtles, which is, <hi>that there is no remiſsion of ſinnes without blood? &amp; that our onelie propitiation is in the onelie blood of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Genebr. in Miſſ. S.

<note place="margin">Leuit. 5.11.</note> And this we ſee to bee directlie contrarie to that which they will make Saint Iames ſay, a Sacrificer notwithſtanding, ſay they both of the one &amp; other Teſtament. Furthermore there are manie things contained therin, which might be verie wel obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and noted for the conuincing of the ſame of error &amp; falſhood, as the <hi>Gloria patri,</hi> and the <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> both which as we ſhall ſee did enter a long time after into the Lithurgies, as alſo prayers for the dead, prayer vnto the holie virgin, &amp;c. which are yet of later time then the other, witnes hereof is likewiſe Epiphanius, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned praying vnto the holie virgin fiue hundred yeares after, who would not haue oppoſed himſelfe as a contrary party to an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt. And without doubt this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurgie hath beene preſented vnto the world vnder this name, for no other end, but that it might giue credite and applauſe vnto all theſe errors. But all theſe particulars ſhall bee ſpoken of euerie one in more fit and conueniente places. One thing wee will not omit, which runneth as a long thread throughout the whole length of the webbe of this Maſſe or Lithurgie, which is that there is an infinit ſort of ſentences and whole clauſes out of S.

               <p>Neither yet haue they anie firmer ground or more aſſured warrant for thoſe Maſſes which they attribute vnto the Apoſtles their Diſciples.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15548:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Corinthians, yea ſuch an other as he neuer receiued, or was taught of Chriſt the Son of God. In the meane time they clap vs vp together a Maſſe of his diuine function, and ſeruice, but farre differing (as ſhall bee ſeene) from that which they themſelues do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and practiſe, and yet notwithſtanding, the ſame hauing as little part and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Denys, as the others had in the Apoſtles.

Let vs come and ſee how theſe bookes can be thought to bee his, hauing obſerued the proofes to the contrarie, as they follow. Euſebius reckoning vp all the famous men in the Church, called by the name of Denys, and whatſoeuer they had written, ſayeth not a word of this man. S. Ierome in his Catalogue of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, ſpeaketh of two or three of this name: but of this man, or of any of his books he is not remembred. Origene, Chryſoſtome and all the firſt Greekes and Latines, in like manner altogether as little.
<note place="margin">Gregor, homil. 33, de decem drachmis</note> Yea Gregorie the great, citing the bookes of this Denys, calleth him not Areopagite. He ſpeaketh of the conſecration of Monkes: who can denie but that theſe ceremonies were vnknowne more then three hundred yeares after Chriſt? And that Denys ſpeaketh alſo of their ſhauing; which cannot bee proued to haue beene knowne or heard of, more then 600. yeares after: ſaue that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in generall termes did admoniſh thoſe of the Clergie, that they ſhould not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion themſelues after the vaine manner of ſuch men, who gloried in their long haire? Of the vſe of Godfathers in Baptiſme; but who is hee that is able to ſhew out of anie old, either Greek or Latine writer, I ſay not this name: but ſo much as any trace or ſmal impreſſion of the thing, for many ages after?

<note place="margin">Dioniſius de diuin. nominib.</note> But what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys ſoeuer this might bee, he neuer ſo much as once pretendeth that it ſhould bee the Areopagite: for in his bookes of diuine names, he reckoneth vp Clement the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and they will haue him to bee the Romaine: but it appeareth that hee was an Alexandrian; ſeeing it is ſo found and proued by a place in his viii. booke: hee liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare 200.

And yet after all this, who is there that will ſtand forth, and warrant vs, that there is no falſhoode in the bookes of Conſtitutions, newlie brought ouer from Candie, by a certaine Venetian called Capellus, in which we may reade this pretended Lithurgie of S.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15548:29"/>Chriſtian, by faith looking and waiting for the Meſſias, which is Chriſt: as in like manner a Chriſtian is a true and naturall Iew of the true ſeed of Abraham; in aſmuch as by the ſame faith he hath receiued Ieſus for the Chriſt. The diuine ſeruice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe amongſt the Iewes, (notwithſtanding that they were darkened in their opinions, by the peruerſe gloſſes of the Phariſies) was abiding ſincere and pure, purged and free from all Idolatrie, in as great meaſure, as euer at any time before, when our Sauiour Chriſt came into the world: whereupon wee ſee, he made it not ſtraunge, neither yet his Diſciples to be conuerſant in their Temple and Synagogues. But on the contrary there was the place, where our Lord did chuſe oftentimes to take occaſion to teach &amp; inſtruct the people, &amp; to interprete the Scriptures, which were therein diligentlie read; as in like manner his Apoſtles did after his example:
<note place="margin">Iohn 18.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow in the time of Conſtantine his rule and gouernment in the Empire,
<note place="margin">A notable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration vnder Conſtantine, &amp; afterward.</note> we ſee and behold the eſtate of the Chriſtian Church to change, from perſecution to peace; from ſeruitude and ſlauerie, to principality, rule and dominion, by remouing out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, to dwell in Citties, and from keeping in caues and holes, to ſit in faire and ſtately palaces: Here we ſee it imbraced of the multitude, entertained of Emperors, and thoſe the moſt famous and worthieſt of all the reſt, namely the Emperours of Rome, and receiued of whole nations, and thoſe ſuch as bare away the pricke and price from the whole world for pride and riotouſnes. Let vs not find it ſtrange, if in this great change we ſee it altogether changed euen at one blow: if the Church embracing the world into her lappe, become ſweld and puffed vp with the ſame in a moment; if the worlde enter into the Church with the worlde, being brought thereinto, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance it obtained: I meane the vanities, ſuperfluities, affections, and imperfections, together with all the reſt of the infections of the world. The Church had beene nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in mountaines and deſerts, ſhe came forth of ſuch places clothed with Camels haire, in all ſo brietie, ſimplicitie, and innocencie. The Biſhops for the moſt part brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her forth into the world, were aſhamed to ſhew her in ſuch ſort vnto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, to them which newly came, or elſe were willing to come out of Paganiſme. Theſe good Emperours likewiſe deſirous to haue her receiued of theſe people, becomming more curious in ſetting out of the vtter partes, then of the inner: of the ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, then of the truth, and of the ceremonie, then of the ſubſtance: did not make conſcience or ſpare to decke her vp after the manner of Paganiſme; to prepare her the glorious ornaments vſed amongſt the Gentiles, and to accommodate and fit thereunto (as farre as they thought poſſiblie they might, without preiudicing of their holy faith) the ſeruice and ceremonies of the Chriſtians to thoſe vſed amongſt the Pagans. And this their courſe and manner of proceeding was called amongſt them zeale and prudencie: which Tertullian, a preciſe and ſeuere obſeruer and challenger of the firſt puritie, had called ſacriledge. Wherein againe they thought it meet to keep ſuch a tempering, becauſe that hauing at the ſame time to care for the ſatiſfying of them of the circumciſion, euen the Iewes, which embraced Chriſtianitie, furthered and helped forward thereto, for the moſt part vpon a conceited opinion that they had dreamed of, of the greatnes of the Meſsias; they thought they might thereby be able to ſhew them the accompliſhment of their expected hope in the outward gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the Chriſtian Church: and where they thought they ought to beautifie her ſimplicitie and nakedneſſe, there they borrowed willingly all they could, either of wordes or ceremonies from the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the whole outward ſeruice both of the Iewes and Gentiles did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt principally in ſacrifices: (thoſe of the Gentiles, hauing no certaine ſcope or marke to ayme at, and thoſe of the Iewes looking all forward vnto Ieſus Chriſt, vpon and in whom they were all founded and finiſhed) it ſeemed hard and harſh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and like to giue much offence, if they ſhould wholly aboliſh all ſacrifices: becauſe theſe proſelites newly conuerted to Chriſtianitie, did not belieue that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could ſtande without ſacrifices; not conceiuing the truth, how that all ſacrifices are nothing, further then they are applied vnto the onely true ſacrifice of the Son of God fulfilled vpon the croſſe. Leaſt therefore they might exaſperate and prouoke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other, the Chriſtians applyed themſelues to heare and ſpeake both of altars and ſacrifices. And becauſe that the Apoſtles had taken paine to beate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15548:34"/>it into their heads and harts, that all ſacrifices tooke their end in Chriſt: they tooke pleaſure in calling their ſeruices, offeringes, and oblations, ſacrifices: the table of the Lord his Altar; the remembrance of his death in his holy ſupper, the ſacrifice of the Altar, a holy hoſt: the Biſhops and Paſtors, Sacrificers, and the Deacons, Leuites, &amp;c. Theſe kindes of ſpeeches being eaſily to bee vnderſtoode of euerie one amongſt them, and ſuch as at that time were not hurtfull, howſoeuer in the ages following, falling out to bee fuller of ignoraunce, and further ſwaruing from the clearenes of the light: they became cauſes of great abuſes, becauſe they would aduenture further, &amp; go from the figure and ſigne, to the thing: from the ſpirit to the letter; from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper manner of ſpeech, into an errour of doctrine. The Gentiles likewiſe had a multitude of Gods, vnto euery one of which they had builded churches, rayſed altars, and made ſacrifices. Now to reſtraine ſuch a people at once, to the ſeruice of one onely God, and that God altogether a ſpirit, to a ſeruice altogether ſpirituall: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a carnall people, a people brutiſhly enamoured with their pompous manner and ceremonies, with their images of wood and ſtone: the wiſedome of man found to be ſcandalous, full of offence, and without the bounds of diſcretion: and therefore would haue regard of the ſaide Gentiles in ſuch ſort, as that they might build them vp, and not pull them downe: and feede them firſt with milke (as they called it) and afterwarde with ſtrong meate, (for ſo this place was then abuſed,)

                  </note> whereas then the firſt ages had ſharpely and couragiouſly conteſted, that to haue many Gods, was not to haue any at all: It was found pleaſing and plauſible, to turne their Gods into Saintes, and their Goddeſſes into ſhe ſaintes, and to place our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs in their roomes: to dedicate vnto them their temples and Altars, to allow them ſacrificing prieſtes, and high prieſtes, to ordaine feaſtes and ſeruices in honour of them. But this matter is handled hereafter more at large. Where (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we come thereto) let vs conſider, ſeeing the ſpirite of man is blinde in the thinges belonging to God) how that theſe good men vnder a ſhadowe of drawing Iewes and Gentiles vnto Chriſt, in courſe of time did faire and ſoftly bring into the Church both Iudaiſme and Paganiſme: I meane their ceremonies and outwarde pompes, ſuperſtitions and vanities, yea and that is worſe, many of their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and preiudicate opinions in the matter of doctrine: and how alſo it followed thereupon, that the people did euerie day apply and ioyne themſelues more &amp; more to the outwarde parte, and put vs in daunger to bee rather Iewes and Gentiles, then true Chriſtians, abuſing the example of Saint Paule, who became (as hee ſaith) a Iew to the Iewes, a Gentile vnto the Gentiles, and euery thing to euerie man, to winne them vnto Chriſt: and that without any manner of conſideration how that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is not giuen to all in one meaſure, or how that euerie man is not capable to ſtand faſt, and keepe his hold in ſuch tickle and ſlipperie places. Neither yet that S. Paule became a Iew, and obſerued the law, but to the end that hee might draw them from their rudiments: or that in like manner by becomming a Gentile, hee held not any thing of their vnknowne God, but rather preached vnto them the ſonne of God come into the worlde, that is to ſay, without the annihilating of the croſſe of Chriſt, without preiudicing, yea to the aduauncing of the veritie, ſimplicitie and puritie of doctrine.</p>
               <p>But as yet the ſubſtance of the truth ceaſed not to ſwimme and flote a long time vpon the face of theſe humane inuentions, being the good ſeed, &amp; husbanded by the care and induſtry of good teachers, who ſuffered not the ſame to be choked &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with the darnell at the firſt blow: vntill the ouerflowing ſtreame of barbarous and rude men, which happened ſome ages after, did vtterly ouerwhelme it, and make an end of the ſame: by occaſion whereof the darke and palpable thicke cloudes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce did burie and ſwallow vp Chriſtianitie. The Paſtors being partly ignorant and partly negligent, ſuffered the darnell to grow: ſo that the darnell occupied the place of the corne, euen the incorruptible ſeed of the word: in ſo much as that the greateſt part of Chriſtendome ſuffered the famine of the true breade, that is, of the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, becomming drunken &amp; oppreſt in the meane time with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiueneſſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15548:35"/>of mens inuentions, the proper darnell-bread, thruſt vpon them vnder the name of traditions. And this is that which we haue now to verifie concerning the matter of the Maſſe, going forward with the handling of the growth and proceeding thereof from age to age.</p>
               <p>And here let vs call to mind in what eſtate &amp; condition we left the diuine ſeruice in the former Chapter. It conſiſted of a general confeſsion of ſinnes; in ſinging of whole Pſalms; in the reading of the holy ſcriptures; in the Paſtor his preaching vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame: after that in a generall prayer for the whole world; in the bleſſing and diſtributing of the Sacraments to all the faithfull vnder both kindes; in a thankeſgiuing for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite receiued of God in Chriſt, renewed in the action of the Sacrament: and how that all this was vttered in a knowne tongue, and a language vnderſtood of all the people, which anſwered thereunto from time to time; the veſſels and apparrell being ſuch as were commonly vſed, &amp; euery thing done in ſimplicity, without vaine oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; void of all manner of wauering ceremonies: and all theſe thinges continued vnto the times and ages that we are now to ſpeake of, being the ſubſtantiall partes of the true and lawfull diuine ſeruice.

But about this time the zeale of Chriſtians waxing cold, they began in the Church of Rome to deuide them into certaine peeces or pawſes, which were called partes, to the end that ſeruice might be made the ſhorter: as we reade in Optatus, who citeth the 2. part of the nine and fortieth Pſalme. And alth ought this diuiding of Pſalmes, into partes, may ſeeme to haue beene in the time of S. Hillarie, yet it was not receined into the Church. Epiphanius calleth them diſtinctions. S.

Chryſoſtome ſerue? But the Councell of Laodicea, is likewiſe plaine and pregnant in this point: Let the Canonical ſcriptures be read in the church, &amp; not any others. S. Ambroſe oftentimes: <hi>What ſeueritie of puniſhment haue we eſtabliſhed in the Church, to the end that ſilence may bee kept whiles the ſcriptures are reading? whereas notwithſtanding, the Pſalmes doe keepe ſilence of themſelues.</hi> And theſe readinges or leſſons were aſwell out of the law, as out of the Goſpell and Apoſtle, as appeareth in infinite places of S. Ambroſe, S. Auguſtine, and others: and that throughout whole books, vntill ſuch time as S. Ierome by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Pope Damaſcene, becauſe the lithurgy ſeemed as then to be too long, did make an extract of certain leſſons out of the Prophets, Epiſtles &amp; Goſpels; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he compoſed the booke, called <hi>Comes,</hi> or <hi>the booke of leſsons:</hi> from which time they began to be in vſe in the Church. Now the Biſhop or Paſtor of the Church was wont to take the place whereof he wold make his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ordinarily out of thoſe leſſons as appeareth by thoſe wordes of <hi>S.</hi> Ambroſe, S. Auguſtine, and others ſo oftentimes vſed: <hi>We haue heard in the leſſon that hath beene read, &amp;c. and vpon the ſame we muſt deliuer and speake as the Lord ſhall vouchſafe to enable vs, &amp;c.</hi> And ſometime out of the Pſalme that had beene ſung, as may be ſeene in S. Baſill vpon Pſalme 114. Or elſe they tooke a whole booke, as S. Auguſtine in his treatiſe vpon S. Iohn: ſaue that vpon the daies of great feaſtes, as the feaſt of the Natiuitie, Eaſter, and Pentecoſt, they choſe out pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked places, from thence to intreate of the hiſtorie and miſterie. And the ſermon was called <hi>Tractatus Sermo,</hi> and from thence grew theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Homilia tractare, de ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periori loco dicere, ſiue de exedra.</hi> And it was the cuſtome of the Paſtor before he began to ſpeake to the people, to pray vnto God, that hee woulde ſhew him the fauor and mercie to teach them well, and to giue them well, and throughly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that which hee ſhould teach them according to Saint Auguſtine his precept: <hi>Before he ſpeake, let him pray vnto God for himſelfe, and for them to whom he is to preach, and let him be</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Orator antequàm dictor:</hi> which is, let him pray before hee preach. And this ſermon did continue (as wee learne out of Saint Baſill) about an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15548:36"/>houre, in the ende likewiſe concluding the ſame with prayer. In Saint Auguſtine: <hi>Conuerſi rurſus ad Dominum, &amp;c. we betake our ſelues againe vnto God, &amp;c.</hi> And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, as this is the principall charge of the Miniſters to preach the worde: as thoſe vnto whom our Lord (deliuering his commiſſion) ſpake in theſe expreſſe wordes: <hi>Go preach the Goſpell vnto all creatures, &amp;c.</hi> So haue we from theſe great and worthie men, infinite ſermons, as by name from Saint Cyprian, Saint Ambroſe, Saint Auguſtine, S. Chryſoſtome, S. Baſill, &amp;c. but not from any one of theſe, any booke of rites or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, neyther yet any patterne of any ſacrifice: And they let not to take great paine to preſcribe and point out vnto vs, the qualities of a preacher, and the partes and conditions of a Biſhoppe, that is worthy the roome and place of teaching the people: eſpecially Saint Auguſtine in his bookes of Chriſtian doctrine: but for teaching of him howe many diuers wayes, and with howe many ceremonies hee ſhould ſay Maſſe or offer his pretended ſacrifice, they trouble not themſelues at all.</p>

<note place="margin">That the holy Supper was frequented at that time of al the faithful.</note> it was ordinarily the cuſtome to beginne with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the holy Supper, eſpecially during the time of their firſt loue and zeale, when as the Chriſtians for the moſt part did communicate euerie weeke: yea and ſome euerie day, the Sacramentes being neuer ſet vpon the Table of the Lorde, but that there would bee a number of faithfull Chriſtians to communicate thereof.

<note place="margin">Hieronymus in Prou. Salo. c. 11.</note> as contrarying his doctrine in many places. For as for the place that is alleadged out of S. Ierome vpon the Prouerbes, who will belieue that it was his, ſeeing that S. Gregorie is there alleadged? and not rather ſome worke of Beda, to whom the beſt learned doe aſcribe it? But what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall chaunge or tranſlation was deſtinated vnto this word, that from an ill throwne Latine word, ſignifying leaue or libertie, it ſhould neceſſarily be drawne in firſt to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a part of Gods diuine worſhip and ſeruice, then a pretended ſacrifice: Thirdly, a worke wrought for the ſaluation of the quicke and the dead: and finally, to leape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the roome of the market place, called <hi>Palladium</hi> in Rome, promiſing as large and plentifull ſtore of wares and marchandiſe for the Chriſtian ſoule, as euer that other did commodities for the carnall bodie? And yet here we are not to omit that which wee haue alreadie touched: namely, that all the ſeruices and exerciſes of the church, as publique prayers, ſinging of Pſalmes, by night, by day, euening, or morning, were called Maſſes, in the ages following: although they medled not at all with the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper: &amp; the reaſon thereof was, becauſe that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian aſſemblies were wont to diſmiſſe themſelues vpon a general praier made, which was called <hi>Collecta,</hi> &amp; ſometimes <hi>Miſſa,</hi> that is, a leaue or libertie to depart, or a Maſſe: in aſmuch as the departure followed imediately after the ſame. This appeareth by S. Benet his rule, wherein after he hath declared the order of prayers and ſupplications to be kept at the houres canonicall: there is added, <hi>Et ſint, vel fiant Miſſae, which is as much as if he ſhould ſay: And then let them depart, giue them leaue to go away.</hi> The ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appeareth by Caſsian to be ſo, who ſaith, ſpeaking of the Monkes of Egypt, that after the Maſſe of the vigils, they were permitted a little ſleepe vntill it was day. And againe, that vpon the Lordes day they had but one Maſſe or departure before dinner, which was reckoned vnto them for their thirdes, and ſixtes, &amp;c. But in as much as in this they were wont to communicate and receiue the Lords Supper altogether: the name by little and little, and by ſucceſsion of time tooke roote and continued, to the rooting out of all others.</p>
               <p>But that we may not content our ſelues with our former ſtore, &amp; go no further, we haue teſtimonies of this diſmiſſion, Maſſe, or departure from the beſt &amp; moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of this our time.

For the bookes of the Hebrewes doe teach vs, that there are ſeauen thinges to bee obſerued in the oblations and offringes of the firſt fruits; The firſt, that the chiefe and gouernours of the houſe, did bring them themſelues vnto the Church porch, and hauing them vpon their ſhoulders, did euerie of them ſay theſe wordes of Deuteronomye, ch. 26. vereſe 3. vnto the Prieſt: <hi>I giue you to vnderſtand this day before God, &amp;c. that I am come into the land which hee had promiſed vnto our Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond; that the Prieſt receiued the basket of euery one from his owne hand, and put it before the Altar: The third, that this excellent place of Deuteronomie, where this thankefulnes is ordained, with ſuch a liuelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the miſeries of the people; and of the mercifulnes of the Lord, ſhould bee read vnto them all along:
<note place="margin">Of the eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Exod. 29.24. &amp; 27.

After which things all and euery one came neere vnto the holy table in decent order and due reuerence, to communicate the bodie and bloud of our Lord; they receiued the holie ſacraments at the hands of the Paſtors, with the moſt ſignificant words that are, either in the Goſpel, or in any of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, lifting vp their hearts on high, and praying to God that it would pleaſe him by the vertue of his holy ſpirit, to giue them the fleſh of his ſonne for their ſpirituall repaſt and foode: and his blood for their drinke vnto eternall life; ſeeing that of his infinit mercie he hath vouchſafed to make them bone of his bones, and fleſh of his fleſh, &amp;c, that ſo they may abide, liue, and dwell continually in him. And during all the time of this action the deuotion of the aſſemblie was cheriſhed and nouriſhed with the reading of the holy ſcriptures, as moſt meete to declare the death of the Lord, vntill his comming, and to record the vnſpeakable benefite of the ſame: with ſinging of Pſalmes alſo, choſen out of purpoſe, both for the calling to minde of man his miſerie, as alſo for giuing vnto them the ſence &amp; feeling of Gods mercie; and thirdly, for the ſtirring of them vp to giue vnto God for the ſame, all vnfained and ſolemne thankes. And finally there followed the diſmiſsion of the aſſemblie, with a praier of the whole people vnto God, containing a briefe thankeſgiuing, for that it had pleaſed him to make them to ſee and taſte the aſſurance of their ſaluation in the communion and participation of his welbeloued ſonne, ioyning therunto the ſinging of the ſong of Simeon, vſed of the old Church, as wee haue alreadie ſeene, to the ſame end and purpoſe. And after the ſolemne and accuſtomed bleſsing, admonition being

I ſpeake nothing of the order of Catechiſing, both publikelie and priuatelie, which was wont to bee appointed and practiſed certaine weeks before, for the inſtruction and examination of ſuch as ſhould be partakers thereof: the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sermon which ordinarily is ſpent in the expounding of the doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnto the people: and that alſo of the after noone, tending to the ſtirring of vs vppe to the giuing of thankes vnto God. Now then let euerie man iudge without being partiall in the matter, in which of theſe two it is, that antiquitie reſteth, and in which it is, that noueltie hath built her ſelfe a neſt: as namely, whether antiquitie dwell with the Church of Rome, which of the old and auncient ſeruice retaineth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the ſleight and vnprofitable rind: or with our reformed Church, which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and reeſtabliſhed, both all the parts, as alſo the ſubſtance thereof vnto his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate and whole right.</p>

               <p>But they tell vs,

And firſt, he that ſhal compare that which the Syrians vſe vnder the name of Baſil, with that which we haue, ſhall find moſt notable differences therein.

Secondly, for that that, which is attributed vnto Chryſoſtome, is not agreed vpon by the copies of Leo Thuſcanus, Eraſmus and Pelargus: one of the making mention of the dead, &amp; of the inuocating of the virgin, there being nothing in the other concerning the ſame: one of them alſo being printed at Rome, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Paris: where may alſo be obſerued the forward readineſſe, and zeale of one place to corrupt and falſifie a thing more then another, which is a matter of no ſmall moment, to cauſe men to doubt of the truth of them both.

                  <hi>That this Leo went about to alter and change that which Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome had ſaid of the priuate Maſſe, into an ill fauoured ſence, and that far from the purpoſe for which he had deliuered it: fitting and applying it to the faſhion of the Latine Church in his time, into which as then they had brought the ſame: for he was Secretarie to Emanuel Emperour of Greece, about the yeare</hi> 1170. <hi>and did interprete vnto him the writinges of Trithemius the Abbot.

Now it is well knowne, that the Greeke Church, did neuer take any acknowledgement of the Bb. of Rome, by this name and title: but that euer ſince the yeare 1054. the Greekes haue degraded him, and ſet vp in his place the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, that is to ſay, more then 30. years before Alexius came to the Empire. And from other places it is to be proued, that the firſt of this name fell to be in the yeare 855. that is to ſay, more then 200. yeares before Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xius: in ſomuch as that this muſt needs be Nicholas the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, of whom Zonarus maketh mention, as liuing in the time of Alexius, &amp; not the Pope.

               <p>As concerning the Decretall epiſtles of theſe times,
<note place="margin">Decretall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> they are not of any better paſſe then the reſt going before. The very ſame reaſons perſwade me to reiect them: beſides the barbarouſnes, the fooleries and ignorances apparant and euident in them.

And yet in

If the firſt did mightily inlarge the bounds of vanities and ceremonies, no doubt the other was not behind in the promoting of ſuperſtition and falſe doctrine. And that we may the more eaſily comprehend &amp; compaſſe the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let vs briefly call to mind in what eſtate and plight wee haue left, either the holy Supper, or the Maſſe, (and by this name onely let vs call it hereafter, ſeeing that this name beginneth to get the vpper hand in this time and age, whereof wee are now to ſpeake.) It was an aſſemblie of Chriſtians, calling vppon the name of God by Ieſus Chriſt, ſinging his prayſes, hearing his worde, attending vnto the expounding of the ſame, as it was deliuered them by the Paſtors: then offering afterward vnto God, in giuing thankes for his graces, for the fruites and goods that hee had giuen them, that ſome part thereof might be conſecrate to the vſe of the Sacramentes, and ſome part imployed in the ſuſtaining and nouriſhing of the poore, or for other ſuch like neceſſities of the Church. And as for the Canon, that is to ſay, that principall part of ſeruice, in which the Sacraments were bleſſed, receiued and communicated, wee haue left it, as it was compoſed and made of a preface, which lifted vp the ſpirites of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15548:46"/>thoſe who were at it, on high; of a rehearſall of the pure and holy inſtitution of the Supper; of a prayer vnto God, that it would pleaſe him to giue an effectuall power, and operation to the ſacramentes, to knit and vnite together more and more thoſe which were communicantes, to Ieſus Chriſt their head, &amp; to the members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which is the Church, and as ſuch to foſter and feed them vp vnto eternal life, with a commemoration of the holy Martyrs; of their life, and of their death, for the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp of the zeale of euerie one ſo farre, as that they may not grudge at, or be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in any thing which might ſerue for the ſetting forth of the glorie of God, neyther yet preferre any thing whatſoeuer to the working and aſſuring of their owne ſaluation: of the participating and communicating of the bodie and blood of our Lord, vnder the Sacramentes of bread and wine, diſtributed and deliuered into the handes of the faithfull: during which action the Chriſtian aſſemblie was occupied in ſinging of Pſalmes, and finally there was the diſſoluing or breaking vppe of the whole aſſemblie concluded and finiſhed by a poſt-communion, that is, by a ſolemne thankſgiuing, for the benefites receiued in Chriſt, and recorded and ſealed in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper. All this ſeruice was in a language vnderſtood of all, common both to the Miniſters of the Church, whom they call Clearkes, and alſo to the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom they call lay men, or the layetie: all, and euery one of which, euen to the ſimpleſt amongſt them, did aunſwere <hi>Amen:</hi> that is to ſay, did ratifie all the whole action, ſo much as lay in them, and put to their vowes and requeſtes vnto all that which was ſaid and done, as vnto thinges by them well vnderſtood. Now let vs in order looke vpon, &amp; ſee that which was added thereunto afterward, and let vs iudge without all partialitie of affection, whether this ſeruice be amended or impaired by ſuch addition and inlargement.</p>
               <p>Certainly if the Mileuitane and Africane Councels had beene well obayed,
<note place="margin">The chaunge and cauſe thereof.</note> wee ſhould not haue had this trouble: for the auncient godly learned fathers that were preſent thereat, ſeeing the licentious ſcope and libertie, that euerie one gaue vnto his owne conceite and fancie: one ſort vnder the ſhadow of tradition, and an other vnder the colour of good intention, had verie excellently ordained &amp; prouided, that no man ſhould dare to take vpon him, the placing or putting in of any thing without the aduiſe of the moſt graue-wiſe, and the authority of the Councels. But bold igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is neuer without preſumption, did quickly ouerskip all theſe boundes: and that ſo much the more daungerouſly, by how much it was ioyned with preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling authoritie, which then grew vp to his height: the authoritie, I ſay of the Romiſh Church, which then ſucceeded the authoritie of the Emperours, and by little and little inthroniſed her ſelfe in their ſeates of more then royall eſtate, thereby growing mightie in power and credite, &amp; nothing leſſe or inferior in being followed in euery thing, as a moſt perfect patterne and example. Then the Gothes, the Hunnes and the Vandales, &amp;c, more then a whole hundred yeares, ſpoiled and made hauocke of the Weſterne Empire, and the Perſians and Parthians of the Eaſterne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followed, that all good literature lay raked vp in the duſt, and in no leſſe wiſe did they weaken the flouriſhing eſtates of all good and naturall policie. The great and worthie perſonages both in the Eaſt and Weſterne partes, were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death, hauing beene in their life time the lightes of the Church, and the ſcourges of heretikes, and hereticall opinions: their ſucceſſors borne and brought vp in barbarouſneſſe, did go before them in power and authoritie, but they did not ſucceed them in like meaſure of ſufficiencie. And this cauſed that the ſeedes of Pelagianiſme and other hereſies, hauing laine a long time rather couered then quenched, did reuiue, and found more carefull huſbanding then the good plantes: becauſe they had more affinitie with common ſence, and the proud aſpiring driftes of our corrupt nature. So then thoſe which could not ſo well make their part good by ſound learning, would yet beare the bell away with ſetting a good face on it: &amp; ſuch as could not feed their flocke with the worde of God, would fill them full with ſuperſtitions &amp; ceremonies, and for want of milke, like vnto drie nurſes, they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15548:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>would ſerue them with the firſt licour that they met withall: and for lacke of bread, they would ſet before them huskes. So then in this time and age we ſee all theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties and innouations to flow in with full ſtreame, without any barre, without any manner of let or bridle. Now became the computation of the ſhepheards Calender, to be accompted of for a worthie peece of hiſtorie, and the dreame, of men for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Goſpell. And the Church likewiſe doth then come forth vpon the ſtage all maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſguiſed with the Pagane and Iewiſh guiſe, and that in a moment; and that not by ſhifting her robes onely, but (which is the worſt of all the reſt) by ſhaking off all the commendable parts of geſture and matter.</p>
               <p>Let vs begin at the Greeke Church.
<note place="margin">Additions in the Churches of the Grecians</note> We haue ſpoken heretofore of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, brought in by Proclus a Patriarch of Conſtantinople, and receiued into the Church, vpon the naked report of a certaine child, who being extraordinarily rapt and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp into heauen, ſaid that hee heard it ſung there. We haue likewiſe handled the point, how in the Councell of Epheſus, as a thing following vpon the diſallowing &amp; condemning of the hereſies held by Neſtorius and Eutyches, it was ſaid: That the holy virgine might bee called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the mother of God. And now further behold a certaine man Petrus Gnapheus, who ſtarted vp in Antioch, and thought to make his aduantage thereof, for the eſtabliſhing of hereſie and ſuperſtition: this fellow was a prieſt of Chalcedonie, and of the ſecte of Eutyches, who through the fauour of Zeno Iſaurus, afterward Emperour, ſhufled himſelfe into the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of Antiochia, by diſcarding Martyrius the true and lawfull Biſhop of the ſame: and being receiued, then it was ordained in his Church, which was of very large precinctes;
<note place="margin">Theodor. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtes in Collecta.</note> that at the end of <hi>Triſagium,</hi> the hymne ſo called, becauſe it contained theſe wordes, <hi>Sanctus Deus, ſanctus fortis, ſanctus immortalis, miſerere nobis,</hi> there was added, <hi>Qui crucifixus es pro nobis, which wast crucified for vs,</hi> applying the ſame to God the father, whom in the vnſoundneſſe of his hereticall aſſertions, hee held to haue ſuffered for mankind, confounding both the perſons and the natures: and Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus ſaith,
<note place="margin">Nyceph. lib. 16</note> that the ſame continued euen vntill his time. And moreouer, that in all the prayers made in his church, the name of the virgine the mother of God was called vpon, with an intent and purpoſe to make this doctrine plauſible and well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Councell of Epheſus, and as a baite for the giuing of free paſſage to the ſwallow of the reſt of his hereſies. Now it followed preſently hereupon, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Leo the great being aduertiſed of theſe nouelties, condemned him into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, vntill ſuch time as he promiſed to diſclaime and giue them ouer, which in deed he did, and made not ſhew to the contrarie, vntill ſuch time as that falſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne Baſilicus went about to ſeize vpon the Empire, by the meanes whereof he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered his libertie and licence to worke miſchiefe both at one time, his doctrine likewiſe being afterward ſupported and borne out by Anaſtaſius the Emperor, being himſelfe an Eutychian. Iuſtinian the Emperour added ſomewhat, but deſtroyed no good thing: for it was by him ordained that there ſhould be ſung in the Chriſtian aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies this hymne,

And this was to honour the holy virgine, according to the intent and purpoſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Epheſus, being without all preiudicing of the honour due vnto God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to all manner of creatures.</p>
               <p>At this time alſo the Letanies or ſupplications were hatched, and that firſt of all in the Eaſterne Churches, and then afterward in the weſterne: not without ſome imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatation of the Pagans their Ambaruales, or Gangweeke: and the occaſion therof did firſt riſe from Conſtantinople, by reaſon of a plague: then from Lyons, by reaſon of an earthquake, from whence they tooke their flight all ouer the Eaſt and Weſt. The forme and manner thereof was this: They contriued and drewe into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15548:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>articles, the publike neceſſities and calamities, that did preſſe them or threaten them: vnto euerie one whereof, as it was vttered and ſpoken by the Prieſt or Biſhop which went before, the people anſwered: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs, Lord heare vs.</hi> Praying vnto Saintes, or yet vnto the virgine Marie, was not admitted till a long time after, ſaue onely where as Anaſtaſius the Emperour, an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychian &amp; fauourite of Petrus Gnapheus his opinions, and an innouator in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, did vndertake to ſet them a foote, and giue them force to ſtand.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the church of Rome, where we ſhal find a great deale more matter,
<note place="margin">Alterations &amp; chaunges in the Romiſh Church. Alcuinus, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Rabanus, Walafridus, &amp;c.</note> Symmachus the Bb. of Rome, about the yeare 506. ordained that euery Lords day, as alſo vpon euery feſtiual day, there ſhold be ſung <hi>Gloria in excelſis:</hi> but this is attributed to Teleſphorus by others. Other ſome diſtinguiſh betwixt both, &amp; ſay, that this man did not ordaine it at all, but onely vpon the day of Chriſt his natiuitie.

                  </gap>. He added in the Councell of Rome held vnder him: That no Prieſt in the Church of Rome ſhal ſay any Maſſe without his priuitie. Now let men iudge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if this bee not to come backe to that which we reade and ſpeake of in other places: That there was not any moe then one Chriſtian aſſemblie in euerie pariſh, in which the faithfull did pray vnto God, heard the Goſpell, and communicated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Sacramentes. Agapetus the firſt did inſtitute the proceſsions,
<note place="margin">Petr. de Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</note> at the firſt, before the Maſſe at Eaſter: becauſe (ſaith Durandus) that the Angels ſaid to the women: <hi>Tell the diſciples, that he will be before them in Galile.</hi> And of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions did ſpring thoſe which were afterward ſaid vppon the Lordes daies. This was about the yeare 535. Vigilius ordained about the yeare 536; That thoſe which were to celebrate the Maſſe ſhould looke into the Eaſt:
<note place="margin">Petr. de Natal.</note> and euer ſince the moſt part of the altars were ſet and turned to ſerue for the purpoſe: Alſo, That the feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies ſhould haue their particular readinges and leſſons: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he would <hi>haue the giftes,</hi> oblata munera,

                  <hi>to bee conſecrated vnto God euery day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one and the ſame order of prayers.</hi> Wherein wee ſee, that the Canon was not then growne to a rule and ſet thing, as wee ſee it was afterward: and in an other place, that the praiers whereof he is vnderſtood to haue ſpoken, are referred; <hi>ad oblata mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera, to the giftes which were offered by the people:</hi> and not to the ſacrifice of Chriſt the Sonne of God, that pretended oblation made by the Prieſt, vnto his father. The feaſt alſo of Candlemas is attributed to him; and there is a reaſon giuen vs for the ſame. <hi>The Pagans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rhenan. in Tertul. de co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona milit.</note> (ſaith Rhenanus) <hi>in the entraunce of Februarie did celebrate the feaſt of Proſerpina with burning tapers:</hi> Now that their wilfull obſtinacie might not bee incenſed or prouoked to diſcontentment, it was ordained, that the ſame day there ſhould be the like burning of them vnto the virgine Marie:
<note place="margin">Iacob. de Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. ſerm. 82. de Sanctis.</note> and Iacobus <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oragine</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſame thing after the ſame manner. Pelagius the ſecond, about the yeare 580. ordained, that mention ſhould bee made of the deade in euery Maſſe, after the eleuation of the hoſt: (whether he meant it of all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, which after the manner of the old Teſtament were wont to be eleuated or lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp, for a preſenting of them vnto God; or of that parte which was put apart for the Sacrament:) for ſo ſpeaketh Hermanus Gigas,
<note place="margin">Hermanus Gigas.</note> vſing the tearmes currant in his time to expreſſe what was then practiſed in this point, not being as then growne to that head and height of corruptneſſe. Whereby appeareth the truth of that which wee ſaid a little before: namely, that that which was done for the dead, was a cuſtome fetcht and deriued from the Paganes, and not grounded vppon any Chriſtian law; a ſufferaunce and not an ordinance of the Church. And thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold wee are come to Gregorie the firſt, who of all theſe ingredientes thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenced and many moe, maketh one Maſſe, which hee calleth the Romiſh or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Gregorie his Maſſe. And this is the point whereuppon wee are nowe to inſiſt.</p>
               <p>Gregory then (as Hiſtoriographers do tell vs) being come to the Archbiſhopricke,
<note place="margin">The notable change and alteration vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gregorie his time.</note> purpoſed to reforme the whole order of the church in al the parts therof; ſo far forth, as that after that Platina had ſpecified the maſſes, ſongs, letanies, ſtations, proceſſions

<note place="margin">Plat. in Grego. magno.</note> &amp;c. <hi>What ſhall I ſay more,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeeing all the whole order and inſtitution of the eccleſiaſticall office, (especially of the old and auncient one) is inuented and approued by him? which would to God we had kept, and not receiued this barbarouſnes, which ſo much diſtaſteth all the learned men that are liuing at this day, &amp;c.</hi> But of a certaintie vnder the ſhadow of redreſsing the order and diſcipline which had ſuſtained great iniuries by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous inuaders and ſpoilers, he did not a little damnifie the truth and ſinceritie of doctrine: wherein yet thoſe which came after and ſucceeded him, (as ſaith Platina) did worſe.
<note place="margin">The Introit.</note> For the lithurgie: It had no Introit in the beginning; and after that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine had made one, Gregorie would haue it doubled and ſung twice. The Pſalmes at the firſt were wont to be ſung intire &amp; whole of all the people, and with one voice, where afterward they were diuided into pauſes, and in the ende into verſes; in the ſinging whereof the Cleargie and the people did by courſe ſing one one verſe,
<note place="margin">Hermanus Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas in Flore temp. Pſalmes.</note> and the other the other. Gregorie appointed an Antiphonarie for the time and ſpace of the whole yeare, conſiſting of Verſicles &amp; Reſponſories for euery day. Likewiſe he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a ſchoole of ſingers to ſing the lithurgie, and hee laboured greatly to haue his ſong or maner of ſinging receiued euery where throughout the Latine Churches, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe much offended with the barbarous voyces of the French,

He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the <hi>Kyrie eleiſon</hi> from the Grecians, and was found fault with therefore: for ſaid ſome: This is far off from reducing the Church of Conſtantinople vnder the church of Rome, ſeeing thereby he did nothing els but draw their faſhions &amp; manners vnto Rome. But he excuſeth himſelfe in theſe wordes: <hi>Amongſt the Grecians all the people doe ſay it; but amongst vs the Cleargie (that is the Miniſters of the Church) onely, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple anſwereth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. l. 7. epi. 63. indict. 2. Prayers.</note> Againe, <hi>Looke how oft we ſay Kyrie cleiſon, ſo many times alſo do we ſay Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte eleiſon: which is not done amongst the Grecians.</hi> For prayer, hee made a booke, ſome part whereof was taken and drawne out of that of Gelaſius, which is called the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, containing thoſe thinges which were to be ſaid euerie day throughout the yeare. <hi>If there be found</hi> (ſaith Walafridus) <hi>any thing in this booke which halteth, it is to be thought,
<note place="margin">Gregor. l. 2. c. 17. Walafr. c. 22. Leſſons.</note> that it is none of his, but that ſome other hath added the ſame thereto afterward:</hi> yea and there are old Maſſe-bookes to be ſeene, where are noted the praiers, ſecrets, and Poſt-communions of Gregorie, to make them tobe knowne from the others, which in deed are more corrupt then his. For the leſſons of the Goſpell and Epiſtle, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth directly and altogether the booke of leſſons, or the bookes called <hi>Comes,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto Saint Ierome: ſaue onely that vpon the feſtiuall dayes, the inſtitution of Pope Vigilius was receiued and kept: and thereto alſo was his booke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes fitted and ſquared, endeuouring to raiſe and draw Anthemes taken out of the Pſalmes, to anſwere to the ſeuerall drifts and purpoſes of the leſſons: whereas before this preſcript forme of reading, the Goſpels, Epiſtles, Propheſies, and other bookes of the old and new Teſtament were read through.
<note place="margin">Sermons.</note> And as for their preachings and expoſitions of the word of God vnto the people, hee ſpeaketh of himſelfe in a certaine place, that he had expounded forty leſſons out of the Goſpel, as it had beene accuſtomed to be read vpon certaine daies in the Office:
<note place="margin">Gregor. in praef. Homil.</note> and that ſome of his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were deliuered by word to his Clearke or Secretarie, that he might afterward reade them to the aſſemblie: and that he had himſelfe pronounced and vttered other ſome of them with his owne mouth. But therewithal he complaineth himſelfe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the iniquitie and abuſe of the time, which had preuailed ſo far, as that <hi>The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the church had left and abandoned the chaire of teaching and preaching of the Gospell,
<note place="margin">Gregor. D. 92.</note> and would not find leaſure to do any other thing then ſing.</hi> And this (ſaith he) grew, becauſe ſinging men were aduaunced and placed in the Miniſterie of the Church, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues to haue diſcharged their duty, when they had opened their pipes, &amp; tickled the people with their ſinging, though they had done nothing vnto them, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in inſtructing of them in the articles of their faith, or in the doctrine of manners. For offerings,
<note place="margin">Offeringes.</note> they continued and were brought in euerie day, notwithſtanding that the Church was growne very rich: in ſo much as that diuers of the old Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained themſelues ſaying, that the Biſhops had not done as Moſes did, who cauſed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15548:48"/>proclamation to be made amongſt the people, that they ſhould not bring any more,
<note place="margin">Gregor. in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogis.</note> when he ſaw that there was enough for the building of the tabernacle. For wee find likewiſe that in the time of Gregorie, there were offered ſheep, and calues, &amp;c, againſt the expreſſe Canon which commanded that nothing but bread &amp; wine ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. But the greater abuſes hapning about the conſecration of the offerings, cauſe vs to leape ouer the other which were not ſo waightie, with a lighter foote.</p>
               <p>Now we haue alreadie ſeene that it was the peoples cuſtome to offer of their fruits and increaſe vnto God, as the old people of the Iewes did: and that theſe fruits were conſecrated vnto him by a holy prayer, after the manner vſed by the Prieſt amongſt the Iſraelites; wherin he was humbly intreated to take in good part that their thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, and to accept of this their ſacrifice of praiſe. And theſe fruits, as all the peace offerings amongſt the Iewes, were lifted vp or ſhaken for to ſhew them vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: after that of the ſame fruits, that is, of the bread and wine, was taken that which was ſufficient for the Sacraments, and the remainder reſerued for the poore, &amp;c. Now all this ſo commendable a cuſtome beganne not to degenerate, but to turne into a plaine poiſon, about this time of Gregorie:
<note place="margin">Walafr. c. 22.</note> and not without iuſt cauſe ſaith Walafri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, ſeeing he ordained the order of Maſſes &amp; conſecrations as well as of ſinging. For in deed the forme of conſecration was ſo far changed at that time, by chaunging of the ſubiect: as that the words properly vſed in the bleſsing of the gifts and offerings, were appropriated directly to the Sacraments.
<note place="margin">The Canon.</note> There then beganne the worke about that part of the Maſſe, which properly they call the Canon. In the Primitiue Church the holy Supper was celebrated euery Lords day, and all the faithfull there preſent, were bound to participate thereof: by little and little thir zeale waxed cold, whereof we heare S. Ambroſe, S. Chryſoſtome, and others to crie out. In the ende it came to that point,
<note place="margin">Can. non iſte C. quotidie. de conſecrat. diſt. 5.</note> that the people did not for the moſt part accuſtome any more to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, neither were they preſſed any thing thereunto by the diligence of the Paſtors. Whereupon likewiſe followed a tolleration and ceaſing from the looking vnto of the ſeueritie and ſtraitneſſe of the Canons; namely thoſe, which enioyned men, that they ſhould communicate at the leaſt three times a yeare, at the natiuitie of Chriſt, Eaſter and Pentecoſt: otherwiſe they ſhould not bee taken for good Catholikes, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was reſtrained to the Natiuitie of Chriſt onely. And thus it came to paſſe,
<note place="margin">Synod. Agath. c. 18.</note> that there was not any one ordinarily to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, ſaue the miniſters of the church, whom they call Clearkes or the Cleargie. And what came vppon this? The Prieſtes notwithſtanding would not leaue taking of offerings: and to the end that the people might not quaile, or let fall their deuotion that way, they make them belieue, that the worke which they doe, doth not ceaſe to profit them, being but onely preſent. But by little and little theſe offeringes were not any longer brought from the table to the Altar, or from the bodie of the Church into the Quire, for to bee conſecrated by the prieſt: as alſo in deed it had beene vndecent, ſeeing they were of ſuch things, as the Canons did forbid, that is to ſay, conſiſting of ſiluer, wooll, cattell, &amp;c: onely that part which conſiſted of bread &amp; wine, and was to ſerue in the Sacrament, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his former courſe. And yet whereas they were wont to conſecrate many loaues for the ſeruice of the whole aſſemblie, being cut into peeces &amp; diſtributed; now the Prieſt contenteth himſelfe with the bleſsing of ſo much as he thought would bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and needfull for the number of communicantes, and that was verie ſmall. In ſo much as that ordinarily hee needed not to conſecrate aboue one loafe, which in Gregorie his time was great, large and round, kneaded after the manner of common bread, and of no other ſubſtance or matter then the ordinarie bread then vſed was: he calleth it <hi>Coronam,</hi> or <hi>Corollam,</hi> and this loafe grew leſſer,
<note place="margin">Greg. l. dial. 4.</note> euen as deuotion it ſelfe diminiſhed, in ſo much, as that within a little after it became nothing, as the Canon teſtifieth, which ſaith: That the Prieſt cannot celebrate the Communion with fewer then three to communicate with him. And thereupon alſo it came vp for a cuſtome to breake the bread made ſo ſmall and thin, into three peeces; whereupon afterward, as we ſhall ſee in place conuenient, diuers and ſundry allegories haue beene fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:15548:49"/>
Now we come by theſe ſteps and degrees,
<note place="margin">The change &amp; alteration, which was ab oblatis ad ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latam.</note> falling out in this time, to paſſe <hi>ab obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad oblatam;</hi> that is, from all ſuch thinges in generall as were offered, vnto this ſmall pettie parte reſerued for the Sacrament, which by corruption came to bee called a Wafer cake; from ſuch breads and loaues, as were vſually brought for offeringes, (as Saint Gregorie teacheth vs) to one onely bread without leauen; which alſo the prieſt himſelfe within a ſmall time after tooke vpon him to prouide for the ſeruice of the Sacrament.
<note place="margin">Gregor. in dialogis.</note> And ſo alſo the praiers and ſupplications which were wont to be ſaid and made in the conſecration of theſe firſt offrings, came to be transferd &amp; applyed vnto the bread and wine appointed and put apart for the prieſt, and that ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie that was to communicate with him. And here it was, that they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues incumbred, whether it were Scholaſticus, or Gregorie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the queſtion was of reforming theſe praiers that made vp a part of the Canon: for in deed theſe words, <hi>Vt accepta habeas &amp; benedicas haec dona, haec munera, haec ſancta ſacrificia illibata: that is, that thou woldeſt accept theſe gifts, theſe offerings, theſe holy and whole ſacrifices:</hi> Againe, <hi>Qui tibi offerunt hoc ſacrificium laudis: that is, which offer vnto thee this ſacrifice of praiſe:</hi> Againe, <hi>Supra quae propitio vultu ac ſereno respicere digneris, &amp; accepta habere ſicuti dignatus es mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera pueri iuſti tui Abel, &amp;c, that is, that it would pleaſe thee to behold them with a mercifull and fauourable countenance, and accept of them, as thou didſt of the offerings of thy righteous Sonne Abel, &amp;c:</hi> Againe, <hi>Iube haec perferri per manus Angeli tui in ſublime Altare tuum, &amp;c: that is, Command that theſe may be conueyed by the handes of thine Angell vpon thine high Altar, &amp;c:</hi> I ſay, all theſe wordes cannot be ſoundly vnderſtood, but of theſe offeringes: nor without folly be turned to the bleſsing of the ſacraments, which wee receiue from God, &amp; in ſtead whereof it pleaſeth him to receiue againe at our hands the ſacrifice of praiſe. No not without blaſphemie can they be wreſted to the oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Prieſt pretendeth to make of the Sonne of God, ſeeing likewiſe that it is ſaid: <hi>Qui tibi offerunt; they which offer vnto thee:</hi> for this muſt needes bee meant of the people that are preſent, and not of the prieſt alone. And yet notwithſtanding all this, they skip me at one iumpe in their Canon, <hi>ab oblatis ad oblatam, from the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and offeringes, to the Wafer cake:</hi> without any manner of agreement, coherence or conſequence: from a ſacrifice of praiſe, to a Sacrament: and from a Sacrament, to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice propitiatorie: from the ſigne to the thing ſignified: &amp; from the remembrance of the death of Chriſt, to the pretended real ſacrificing &amp; offering vp of himſelf. And they will haue it, that all this which hath beene ſpoken and ſaid of theſe offeringes, ſhould bee ſpoken of Chriſt, whom they pretend to offer and ſacrifice vp vnto God: notwithſtanding whatſoeuer abſurdities in conſtruction and diuinitie vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing and ouerthrowing them in their fond and blinde aſſertions: As namely in Diuinitie theſe: That he would be intreated to vouchſafe to accept of the ſacrifice of his onely begotten ſonne, as he did of that of Abel: That his Angels ſhould offer him vp vnto him vpon his Altar: and a thouſand ſuch impertinent thinges, which ſhalbe better examined in their place. And notwithſtanding after certaine praiers which ſtand indifferent betwixt both, they cannot looke to themſelues to goe on with the courſe which they are fallen into, but they returne againe vnto theſe offringes, yea and that after the conſecration: <hi>Per quem</hi> (ſay they) <hi>haec omnia Domine, ſemper bona creas, ſanctificas, viuificas, benedicis, &amp; praestas nobis, by whom thou O Lord, doeſt alwaies create, ſanctifie, quicken, bleſſe and giue vs all theſe good thinges, &amp;c.</hi> which is moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and directly applyed to, <hi>dona, munera, ſacrificia illibata, to the giftes, offerings, and whole ſacrifices:</hi> and was wreſted by them firſt to the Sacraments, and afterwards to the ſacrifice of Chriſt himſelfe, which by ſuch their accompt and reckoning, they did acknowledge for a creature, that was to be created, ſanctified, quickened and bleſſed day by day. And in deede in the lithurgie which they attribute to Clement, yea and that after the conſecration they pray, <hi>Pro dono oblato, for the gift offered:</hi> but in no ſuch ſence or meaning as the Romiſh Maſſe, that is to ſay, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>That it wold pleaſe that our good God, to receiue it vppon his holy Altar by the interceſsion of Chriſt, for a ſweete ſauour:</hi> which cannot by conſequent bee ſpoken of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>

In the Seruices going before there was mention made of Saintes and Martyrs,
<note place="margin">The Praiers of the Saints.</note> the names wherof, as ſayth S. Denys, were read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of a certain regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or catalogue: partlie to ſhew vs that they did liue and make vppe one part of the Church: and partlie to encourage vs to follow their example: and afterwarde the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions or rather ſuperſtitions of ſome particular people had brought it ſo aboute, as that they were prayed vnto. But in this Canon they are a great deale more forward; namelie, to pray vnto God, that hee would receiue their merites and interceſſions for the liuing. And it was in this time that Gregorie would haue it put into the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for the virgin Marie; <hi>Ora pro nobis Deum, pray vnto God for vs.</hi> And this in tract of time, became common, and was not thought vnmeet or vnworthie of anie one of the Saints. And indeed it is moſt cleare, that in the time of S. Auguſtin, not the Saints, but God alone was prayed vnto in the preſcript forme of the celebrating of the Lords Supper. The place is plaine and euident; <hi>They are named</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>as men of God,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Ciuit. Dei. l 22. c. 10.</note> which by ſtanding vnto their confeſſion haue ouercome the worlde: but they are not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto by the Prieſt, which ſacrificeth,</hi> that is, which performeth the holie office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Afterward there was taken vp a cuſtome, that they which died,
<note place="margin">Prayer for the dead.</note> ſhould beſtow ſome giftes vpon the Church; and their kinſfolke for them; that they might be diſtributed vnto the poore: and theſe gifts were wont to be bleſſed, as the other giftes &amp; offrings were: but by this meanes men fell into the fowle errors of the Pagans, as namelie either to pray for the dead, or to moue it themſelues, that they might be prayed for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. And this is it which we haue before obſerued to haue in expreſſe wordes been ordained by Pelagius the ſecond. As then offringes grew to come in place of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: ſo theſe giftes in their place did grow to bee ſacrifices for the dead: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we read thoſe wordes in S. Gregorie:
<note place="margin">Gregor. in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 4. &amp; paſſim.</note> 
                  <hi>To offer a wholeſome and ſauing hoſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one;</hi> vnknowne to the a ges going before; and after which a certaine time ſprung vp the Maſſes for the dead. And thus this parte is receyued againe into the Canon, in more forcible tearmes then before; although as yet not receyued and practiſed euery where: for there are as yet ſome Maſſe bookes to bee found,
<note place="margin">The old Maſſe booke of Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich. Bullinger de origine erroris c. 8.</note> and thoſe verie auncient and authentike, where prayer for the dead is not any thing ſpecified at all. Againe, if we waigh and conſider well the wordes of the Canon; <hi>Pro his qui dormiunt in ſomno pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, for ſuch as ſleepe the ſleepe of peace:</hi> they may ſeeme rather to concerne the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of ſuch, whoſe ſaluation is ſure and certaine, or the opinion of men, as it was then moſt commonly receyued, of a place of refreſhment, or reſt, where they wait &amp; attend the fulnes of glorie to be inioyed after the reſurrection, then anie opinion of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie full of tormentes: or elſe the forme of prayer vſed at this day, for the deliuering &amp; ſetting at libertie of the dead.</p>
               <p>For the liuing,
<note place="margin">For the liuing.</note> Gregorie bringeth in the cuſtome of making mention of them in the place of the myſteries, (as wee ſee) hee writeth vnto Conſtantius Bb. of Millaine,
<note place="margin">Gregor. l. 3. Epiſt. 37. &amp; l. 6. Ep. 71.</note> that it is done (by name) of Iohn Bb. of Rauenna: although before the ordinance and appointment of Innocent the firſt, there was nothing ſpoken of any in that place, ſaue ſuch as had offred, whoſe names were wont to bee read in the place of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. And thus wee ſee clearelie, that all that which is ſaid and done in the Canon for the liuing and for the dead, is traduced and wrung from the Sacrifices of praiſe, that is from the offringes which the Chriſtians offred, whether they were as tokens of their plentifull increaſe, or for to impart and beſtow vpon the poore, to this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded propitiatorie ſacrifice of the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Now Gregorie telleth vs that the author, be it of the Canon,
<note place="margin">Who ſhoulde bee the author of the Canon. Gregor. l. 7. Ep. 63.</note> or be it of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Canon, was one Scholaſticus: and of him we finde not a iot in Euſebius, S. Ierome, Sophronius, yea nor in Gimodius, though he haue drawne a catalogue of eccleſiaſticall writers, about the yeare 500. inſomuch, as that hee cannot bee eyther anie ancient author, or worthy perſonage, as may alſo be eaſilie gathered of his work. And as for them, who to acquite themſelues ſomewhat the better, ſay that it was Pope Gelaſius called by Gregorie, by the name of Scholaſticus, as willing by this title to ſignifie the worthy account and name which he had obtained before hee came to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15548:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>Popedome: it is anſwered them that it appeareth by other places of S. Gregorie, that this Scholaſticus was a proper name, and verie vſuall: for a Iudge of Champagnie in Italie,
<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. 2. Ep. 54. &amp; l. 6. Ep. 14.</note> and an other, who ſtoode out for a defender of the Church, are both of them called by that name. But wee know from elſe where by the hiſtorie of the Church, all whatſoeuer is attributed to Gelaſius, who therein is neuer called nor qualified by the name of Scholaſticus: beſides, that it is moſt plaine, that Gregorie had rather haue adorned and marked it with his proper name, which carried ſo great honour with it, then with a borrowed name, which wee know not whether euer it were beſtowed vpon him or no. Againe, it is not the phraſe or cuſtome to call men, yea and thoſe greate perſonages, by the firſt and leaſt offices which they haue borne, but by the laſt, as being ordinarilie the moſt worthy and excellent.</p>
               <p>But whoſoeuer it was that was the author,
<note place="margin">The three petitions.</note> S. Gregorie doth not let to take it in hand againe after him, as is very apparant vnto vs: and indeed it is agreede vpon that hee did adde thereunto; <hi>Dieſque noſtros in tua pace diſponas, &amp;c.</hi> which they call <hi>the three petitions;</hi> iſſuing and proceeding euermore from that ſpirite, which wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the offringes of the faithfull vnto the ſacrifice offred by the Prieſt. For the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Leo the firſt, which was called (as yet the Maſſe is called) <hi>Super oblata, vppon the giftes and oblations,</hi> it did onely carrie and containe, <hi>That it would pleaſe thee O Lord to receiue and take in good part theſe giftes of our bounden dutie, and of all thy family;</hi> And after ſome Authors, <hi>And diſpoſe of our dayes in peace,</hi> that is, to continue vnto vs of thy fauour and mercie, thy holy bleſſinges, according to the praier of the Iſraelites. But Gregorie, which ſticketh faſt to the pretended offring of the bodie of Chriſt, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further; <hi>To deliuer vs from eternall damnation, and to ingraft vs into the number of thine elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after this conſecration, the Prieſt and Miniſters of the Church were wonte to communicate,
<note place="margin">That the Communion is the moſt part of it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. Iohn Diac. l. 2. c. 41.</note> as wee haue ſaid, and conſequenthe the people; to whome the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were diſtributed, euen yet in the time of Gregorie, with theſe wordes: <hi>The bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, preſerue thy ſoule vnto eternall life: The blood of our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, ſo oft as they did preſent themſelues at the ſame. But as the people became careleſſe and negligent in the communicating of the ſacramentes; and the Prieſtes verie eager and forward in hauing them ſtill to continue their offringes, they beginne to giue them to vnderſtand, that it is ſufficient for them to heare the Maſſe without anie communicating in the ſame. Whereupon within ſome time after, there beganne to grow vp this manner of ſpeaking, to heare the Maſſe, and to ſing the Maſſe, which was vnknown, &amp; neuer had been heard of in al the former ancient times: &amp; in ſumme, that if they did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in the Sacrament, that yet they had their part in the ſacrifice, &amp;c. And ſo from hence by little and little crept in the priuate Maſſes, eſpeciallie in the Monaſteries, at which the people would bee preſent; but the Prieſt alone, or with him ſome certain number of Monkes, or Clearks, did onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. And then theſe wordes; <hi>Corpus Domini, &amp;c. &amp; Sanguis Domini, &amp;c. cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat animam tuam in vitam aeternam: The bodie or the blood of our Lord preſerue thy ſoule vnto eternall life:</hi> which were wont to bee ſpoken to all manner of perſons, and to ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſexe; and who aunſwered thereunto, Amen; tooke vppe their habitation in the Maſſe; at the firſt, for thoſe few perſons which did communicate with the Prieſt, and in the end, for himſelf alone. And yet notwithſtanding, to continue, and hold on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in their contradictories, although hee tell them, that they are for himſelfe, and accordingly do take them himſelfe: yet in the Prayers following afterward, hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fondlie of al; <hi>Quod ore ſumpſimus Domine, fac pura mente capiamus: Grant Lord, that what wee haue taken in at our mouthes, we may receiue with pure and cleane minds, &amp;c.</hi> Which is the cauſe that ſome olde expounders of the Canon, helde opinion, that it could not be read but in publike Maſſes, ſuch as in which the people was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacramentes, that is to ſay, according to the Canons of this time, in any caſe at the feaſt of the Natiuitie, at Eaſter and at Pentecoſt; becauſe it is altogether ſet down in tearmes of the plurall number.</p>
               <p>And yet S. Gregorie had this one good thing in him, namelie, that he alwaies left
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15548:50"/>it in the libertie of the Churches,
<note place="margin">Gregory doth not preſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Maſſe. Gregor. in Ep. ad Auguſt. Anglic. Epiſc. Change of ſpeech. Sabel.

For in the Epiſtle likewiſe, which hee writ vnto Auguſtine a Biſhoppe in England, who would haue brought it into England, hee vſeth theſe wordes: <hi>The Churches haue diuerſe formes of celebrating the miſteries: It is left in the libertie of euerie one of them to follow that which ſhall like them beſt: In euerie Church take and retaine that which thou ſhalt finde the beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs yet furthermore adde two other verie great changes and alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this time; the rather, becauſe they are in thinges that are ſenſible, and to bee conceiued of euerie one. The one is, that about the yeare ſixe hundred, (as wee reade in Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus) the ſwarmes of barbarous people continued in Italie, France, and Spaine for a long time, where the Latine tongue was receiued, and by conſequent the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Church in Latine: but by little and little it was found in ſuch ſorte to bee corrupted and chaunged into Italian, Spaniſh, and French, as that it was not anie longer to bee vnderſtoode of the common ſort, and further in ſpace of time, from age to age it ſtill became more obſcure and intricate. Whereuppon inſued though not by anie decreed ordinance, but eyther by too much tolleration and ſufferance, or elſe by negligence, that the ſeruice continuing in Latine, &amp; the people growing to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it nothing at all; euerie thing was done in the Church, contrarie to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Apoſtles, the vſe of the auncient Churches,
<note place="margin">Iuſtin Nouel. 123.</note> yea and the verie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces of the Emperours, in a language that was not vnderſtoode: and by conſequent without edification, and the meanes for the people to come by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The other is, that in ſteade of the Chriſtian ſimplicitie,
<note place="margin">Alteration in apparrell.</note> which was eaſie to bee ſeene and obſerued, in the habites, apparell, and garmentes of the Paſtours that celebrated the Sacramentes and other holy exerciſes: Gregorie brought in the pontificall and ſtatelie garmentes; imitating therein,
<note place="margin">Raban. l. 1. Inſtitut. c. 14.</note> (as ſayeth Raba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus) the Iewiſh Church, the Prieſtes and Leuites; as alſo their conſecrations, annointinges, and purifyinges; yea, and that in the matter of Temples, Altars, garmentes, veſſels, and euerie thing that is of vſe in the Church; thinges alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnknowne vnto his time, and not finding anie manner of grounde or foundation in anie of the olde Writers, except one weake and reeling Canon, which appointeth for the Readers, <hi>Laeuam lino tectam, the left hand couered with ſome linnen;</hi> and ſome Surpliſſe made of them for the Prieſtes. And yet this riſeth from hence onelie, namely, that Innocent the third, maintained that the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law were not aboliſhed.
<note place="margin">Innoc. 3. lib. 4. de Sacr. Altar. cap. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And yet it was too great a worke, (notwithſtanding that the foundation of abuſes, and ſuperſtitions, were deepelie laide in the time of Gregorie:) for the vpper building and top-frame to be finiſhed therewithall at a trice. For both in his time and afterwarde that law remained in the Church: That the faithfull did communicate after the conſecration of the Sacramentes: and the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors did blame and finde faulte with all careleſſe negligence therein, as they eſpied and founde it out: exhorting and ſtirring vppe their Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to continue their zeale and forwardnes in the participating of the ſame: they continued alſo to adminiſter it vnder both kindes, yea, and it was ratified and confirmed by the ordinances of the ſtate Politique, now and then, as wee ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>

Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as that whatſoeuer wee haue of his at this day, was ſaued at the requeſt of one Petrus Diaconus, hauing ſome care of the ſame. But it was to verie good purpoſe, that hee had in his life time left the forme of ſeruice, to the diſcretion of the Paſtors; and that thoſe, which preſentlie after ſucceeded him, did not ſtirre much or trouble themſelues in cauſing of his to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; for by that meanes the Churches remained a long time, inioying their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in ſuch ſort as wee haue alreadie acknowledged to bee contained in the Canons of the Councell of Venice and Gerond, helde about the yeare 500. and 550. that is to ſay, that all whatſoeuer was to bee got thereby, was; That in one and the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, or vnder one and the ſame Metropolitane, there was obſerued one and the ſame ſeruice: except it were in ſuch countries, as where Chriſtianitie did ſettle it ſelfe a freſh, for there the reformers, ſent thether from the Popes, cauſed them ſtrictlie and directlie to admit and follow the Romiſh order.</p>
               <p>In France, this Auguſtine a Monke of Rome, of the Order of S. Bennet, trauelling on the behalfe of Gregorie into England; found himſelfe offended, that the Order of Rome was not obſerued, and thereupon did write vnto Gregorie, who repreſſed &amp; redreſſed his ouer forwardnes in theſe wordes: <hi>That hee muſt take that in euerie Church which is good, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, the authoritie of the French Church was then ſo great, as that it helde his councels apart, and within it ſelfe, and not fearing or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon whatſoeuer anie man could or would gain-ſay, as caring but a little, or elſe nothing at all for the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>In England,
<note place="margin">The Romiſh Maſſe firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in England.</note> where hee thought hee ſhould find a greene ground, that neuer had beene husbanded or tilled, hee proceeded further, inſomuch as that hee procured from the Pope, to bee created Archbiſhoppe of Canterbury: and the rather, becauſe of his good happe ſo ſeruing him to meete with an ignorant king, and a ſuperſtitious Queene: and there hee preached (ſo was it called) the Chriſtian religion, that is to ſay, all the ceremonies and trumperie of Rome; as their Maſſes, Letanies, Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Copes, Veſtmentes, Altars, Candleſtickes, holie Waters, Conſecrations, &amp;c. and there hee brought to paſſe to haue them receiued: and yet vpon condition, <hi>That no man ſhould bee forced or constrained thereunto.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beda lib. 1, &amp; 2.</note> But going about to purchaſe ſtill further credite to himſelfe, and beginning of a wilie Foxe to play the fierce and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lyon, a famous Abbot named Dinoth, a great Diuine, who taught vnder him more then two thouſande Monkes, for the Nurcerie of ſeauen Dioceſſes in England, oppoſed himſelfe verie ſtoutelie againſt him, in a full Synode, and boldly auouched, that hee ought not to chaunge the olde and auncient formes of Chriſtian religion, refuſing therewithall to acknowledge him for an Archbiſhoppe, &amp;c. inſomuch, as that this good Auguſtine did incenſe Ethelfred king of Northumberland againſt him, who cauſed him to bee knockt in the head with twelue hundred of thoſe that did belong vnto him. From that time forward, the people being bold, and farre from feare, about the yeare 637. at the earneſt ſute of Pope Iohn the fourth, and the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Laurentius, Mellitus, Iuſtus Honorius and others, ſent from the Sea of Rome one after an other, to preſſe and vrge forward the kinges and Cleargie of England, for the entertayning of this change and alteration, beganne to celebrate the feaſte of Eaſter after the manner of Rome. And about the yeare 666. the Biſhoppes receiued
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15548:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhauing and vnction: and the Paſtors which were there, beganne to bee called <hi>Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that is to ſay, Prieſtes.</hi> Afterward, about the yeare, 679. there was eſtabliſhed the manner of celebrating in the Latine tongue,
<note place="margin">Beda lib. 4. c. 18. de geſhs Anglor.</note> at the great labour and diligence vſed by an Archchanter, or chiefe ſinging man of Rome, whom the Pope Agatho ſent thether: and as for the playing of organes, it being added vnto the Romiſh manner of ſinging by Pope Vitalian, Beda could not abſtaine but ſay; Heretofore in ſteade of theſe thinges the principall ſeruice of God conſiſted in the preaching of the Goſpell, and hearing of the word of God.</p>
               <p>But as the Romains thought not themſelues abſolute Lordes and Conquerours of anie Countrie, who did not conſent to liue according to their lawes,
<note place="margin">The Romiſh Maſſe firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in Italy</note> &amp; ſpeak their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: euen ſo the Popes at this time aſpiring vnto, and greedilie gaping after the Monarchie of the Church, did not thinke, or make account of hauing the ſame in good earneſt, except they brought it to bee ſubiect vnto their lawe of the Latine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and that ioyned with the Latine tongue. And as Pipin and Charles the great, new vſurpers both ouer the French, as alſo ouer the Empire in the Weſt, had great neede of their fauour, for the authoriſing of them, and making of their places to be graunted and acknowledged, as rightlie deſcending vnto them by the people: ſo the Popes did not ſpare to looke to receiue from them againe, a giue for their gaue: as namelie, to eſtabliſh their lawes, ſeruices and ceremonies, ſo farre as they ſhoulde be able, that is, ſo farre as their authority or ſword might eſtabliſh and ſettle the ſame. Thus Adrian the firſt, about the yeare 790. held a councell in Rome,
<note place="margin">Adr. D. 63. Durand. l. 5. c. 2.</note> wherin hee cauſed to bee ordained, that Gregories Maſſe ſhould bee obſerued in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches.

Now in the Morning when they ſhould come to open the dore, they found the Maſſe-booke of S. Ambroſe open and whole, and in the ſame place where they had laid it: and contrarywiſe, that of S.

The three eſtates of the Realm fell to be verie turbulent; and yet notwithſtanding the king would not goe backe from his worde, to the procuring of his leaſt diſcredite: inſomuch as that in the end the thing came to this iſſue, namely, that it ſhould bee decided by a combat: and thereuppon there was named and choſen for the king a Knight, and hee ſhould fight for the French or Gregorian Office, and by the States an other, and hee ſhould fighte for the Office of Toledo. But the kinges Champion, as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hiſtorie, was quicklie ouercome, not without the exceeding ioye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing of the States, for the victorie obtayned of their Champion for the Order of Toledo, who was of the houſe of Matanza neere vnto Piſorica, whereof there is a hardie and valiant race and offpring remaining aliue yet vnto this daye.

And now likewiſe it ſo fell out, as that the booke of the French Order was burned and conſumed all into aſhes, whereas on the contrarie, that of the Order of Toledo remained whole, not ſo much as ſmelling of any flame.

               <p>Now let vs come to that which theſe ages and latter times haue added ouer and aboue vnto the making vp of the Maſſe: firſt, we reade how that in the time of Agatho,
<note place="margin">Additions to the Maſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time of Gregorie. Plat. in Agath.</note> that is to ſay, about the yeare 670. Iohn Biſhoppe of Port did ſay the firſt Latine Maſſe in the Temple of S.

But was hee not aſhamed for the inſinuating of himſelfe into the fauour of the Grecians, to father vppon Chryſoſtome a booke of the Maſſe, ſeeing wee finde it euident by that which hath beene ſaide heretofore, that it was not poſſible for him to heare it once ſpoken of in this ſignification?
<note place="margin">Proceſſions.</note> In the ſecond place, Gregorie the firſt had inſtituted a proceſſion to bee made vppon Eaſter day with a ſupplication or Letanie. Now the ordaining of theſe ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Proceſſions, did firſt riſe vppon the occaſion of publike calamities, as of the plague, of the earthquake, &amp;c. for the taking away whereof the people ioyned together in prayers vnto God. But Honorius the firſt appointed that euery Lordes day, there ſhould be a Proceſſion made at Rome, from the day of S. Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris vnto the daye of S. Peter, with Gregorie his Letanie. Some attribute that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce to Agapet. Sergius as a thirde Promoter of this worke of augmentation followeth aboute the yeare 690. and caſteth in vnto the reſt all the feſtiuall dayes, as namelie, the fowre Ladie dayes: and thus more and more ſuperſtition increaſed, as the Moone when ſhee is paſt the change, vntill it had gained the place and preheminence vpon the Lords dayes, and that in all places. This is the thing that Charles the Great, the true and truſtie aduancer of all Romiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions ſpeaketh of: <hi>Let the Prieſt with the companie of ſingers goe aboute the Church,</hi> &amp;c.

But as the people grew ſlower and ſlower in communicating; ſo they perſwaded them ſo much the more to bring offrings, yea conſtrained them thereto by the Canons of their Synods, and by the lawes of the Empire: and to this end they made men belieue that it was ſufficient for them to bee preſent onelie, ſo that they forget not to offer, in ſo much that Maſſes and Altars did multiplie, the communion in the meane time wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and falling away; and that ſo farre foorth, as that the Prieſtes themſelues ſometimes did not receiue it,

Let vs alwaies call to mind; that the holy Supper by hy his firſt inſtitution, was a remembraunce of the death and paſſion of our Lord, and a communicating of the faithfull in the bodie and blood of the ſame, with the creatures of bread and wine, as ſeales and aſſurances of eternall life: and wee haue ſeene the making of a Supper without any Communion; a pretended ſacrifice without any remembraunce of the death of Chriſt. But now it becommeth a cuſtome to vſe it in remembraunce, not any more of the paſſion of our Lord, and of the merite of his croſſe, but of the Saints,

And who will find it ſtrange, that the people did caſt off the holy ſupper, for to runne to the Maſſe, the practiſe whereof is ſo eaſie, and yet withall ſo readie to bring ſaluation? where there is nothing to do but to caſt abroad the eyes, without taking any due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of any thing, or to open the eares, without the vnderſtanding of any thing. Againe, it is ſcarce credible, how vnder the ignorance of theſe times, it was receiued of kingdomes and commonwealthes, and the Lordes ſupper laide aſide, as a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt iudgement of God, for the deſpiſing of his holy inſtitution, and caſting of it far from them, for from hence forwarde you heare not any thing ſpoken, but of the founding of Maſſes: all whatſoeuer duties belonging to the quicke or the dead are reduced into that: all the whole order of prieſthood hath no other occupation. And whereas our Lord had ſaid vnto all his Apoſtles: <hi>Go and preach the Gospell vnto all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptiſe, do this in remembrance of me:</hi> about the yeare 1000. they beganne to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and make prieſtes,

And which is worſe; to aduance and raiſe themſelues in authoritie from day to day aboue the laytie: firſt they bring in a cuſtome, that the laitie ſhould not communicate any more with the Prieſt but onely three or foure of the Clearkes: and afterwarde neither laitie nor Clearkes, ſetting it downe that it was ſufficient if there were one anſwerer, whome they called <hi>Gampanarium, that is, he who is wont to ring the hell.</hi> And finally the laitie came to be almoſt quite ſhut out from all, for the Prieſtes euen then when they were to communicate, did take from them the cuppe of the Lord; and to leaue them ſome ſhadow and blind picture of the ſame, they allow and permit them onely to waſh their mouthes: whereas the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Drinke ye all of this:</hi> which all the church vnderſtandeth to bee, that, <hi>All the people haue commandement to take and to drinke.</hi> Now alſo this is the reaſon, wherefore by degrees they came to this little bread or wafer cake vſed in the Maſſe. For as the aſſemblies were great, ſo they brought many great loaues, which were cut in gobbets, and diſtributed vnto the people: and as they grew to drawe backe, and to diminiſh in number, came the decree of Clement the third: that there ſhould not be any more bread ſet vpon the altur, then ſhould bee neceſſarie and requiſite for the number of the people that was to communicate. And ſo in the end it comming to this, that there did not any moe but the prieſt and his clearke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate; yea &amp; for the moſt part none but the prieſt himſelfe alone: from many loaues of an ordinarie bigneſſe, they came to one great one, and from one great one to a middle ſiſed loafe: and in the end to this little one (ſaith Durandus) of the bignes of a penie, <hi>denarioli.</hi> And to help and ſalue all the whole matter,

If the Waldenſes, and after them the Albigenſes, which haue replanted Chriſtianitie by their diſpearſinges and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes, according to the purenes and ſinceritie of the Goſpell, did teach at this time; that the Maſſe did retaine and hold nothing of the inſtitution of Chriſt, neither for the liuing nor for the dead: that the conſecration was not tyed to the wordes of the Canon, but to the Lordes inſtitution: that the holy Supper ought to be celebrated according to that inſtitution, or elſe that it is no ſupper: that all other ceremonies therein are vnprofitable, and the vulgar or naturall tongue of euery people neceſſary for the inſtruction of the people, &amp;c.

Saint Chryſoſtome will yet giue vs in a clearer teſtimonie, himſelfe adminiſtring the Sacraments in that famous citie of Conſtantinople: for wee may not imagine to finde in him this Maxime grounded:
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 8. ad Cor. ho. 18.</note> that it behoueth that in the ſacramentes the prieſtes ſhould be priuiledged to receiue one kind more then the laitie, ſeeing euen in the entrance he giueth vs an other rule cleane contrarie: <hi>There is a thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the prieſt differeth nothing from him ouer whom he hath charge, that is, from the lay man: as for example, when the enioying and receiuing of the high and reuerent myſteries is called in queſtion: for we are all alike thought worthy to receiue them: and not as in the old law,
<note place="margin">Hom. 84. in Matth.</note> where the prieſt did eate his part alone, and the people theirs by themſelues; ſo as that it was not lawfull to take part of that which was appointed for the part and portion of the prieſt. It is not ſo at this day, but there is ſet before and giuen to all one and the ſelfe ſame bodie, &amp; one and the ſame cup.</hi> The lithurgie alſo which they attribute to him, doth ſo celebrate the ſame. And when he would ſtirre vp the people to reuerence the ſacraments, he doth it alwaies by ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together of both kindes; <hi>What manner of mouth wilt thou bring for this bread?
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. de Euchariſt. Theophilact. in 1. Cor. c. 11. Idem in Ioha. c. 10. Idem in Ioh. c. 10.</note> and what manner of lips for this cup?</hi> and ſuch like ſpeeches.

And thereupon Leo the Pope ſaith in a ſermon: <hi>They take in their vnworthie mouthes the bodie of the Lord, &amp; refuſe altogether to drinke the blood of our redemption:</hi> which he calleth a ſacrilegious hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and applyeth to the ſame purpoſe the words of S.

But as euerie Proceſſe doth intend an arreſt, and hereſies ingender decrees: ſo there being certaine preſumptuous and ſuperſtitious prieſtes about the yeare 540. which were tampering to ſeperate the bread from the cup, Pope Gelaſius vttereth his iudgement;
<note place="margin">De conſecrat. D. Can. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there are ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued the bodie, do abſtain &amp; refuſe to receiue the cup of the ſacred blood: whom, ſeeing ſuperſtition hath blinded them, we will either wholly &amp; entirely to receiue the Sacraments, or els to be wholly &amp; vtterly reſtrained &amp; ſhut out from the ſame: becauſe that the renting a ſunder and diuiding of one and the ſame myſterie cannot be done or tollerated without great ſacriledge.</hi> Note and marke that he ſaith <hi>Superſtition,</hi> not <hi>hereſie.</hi> He ſpeaketh not then of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, as Leo doth, but of other perſons receiued into the Chriſtian Church. Again, that Gelaſius ſaith and declareth; that not to receiue any more then the bodie, is not to receiue the whole Sacrament: but to the contrarie, it is ſo far from receiuing the Sacrament, as that it is nothing elſe but a notorious inwrapping of a man in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And here Gratianus his Gloſſe is not to be admitted, that this Canon is to be vnderſtood of certain prieſts, who hauing conſecrated both kinds, did take but one of them: neither yet the deprauing and corrupting of the ſame, as it is done by ſome Chroniclers, who to apply themſelues to the abuſes of their times, ſay that Gelaſius ordained this Canon, that the prieſts ſhould not conſecrate the one kind without the other. For here I would aske of them, if they conſecrate both, what muſt bee done then with the other? but if one onely muſt be conſecrated, then I would know of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where I might find any hiſtory making mention therof? But the truth is, that by that Canon are condemned ſuch ſuperſtitious perſons as would receiue but the one, as may well be collected out of theſe words: <hi>Ab integris arceantur, let them bee wholly put backe &amp; debarred:</hi> which muſt needs be applyed vnto the parties receiuing, and not to the parties diſtributing. Now ſuperſtition is called of the ſchoolemen, <hi>Cultus Dei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debitus; that is, when one ſerueth God after his owne manner, &amp; not according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes.</hi>

               <p>As likewiſe Beatus Rhenanus reporteth, that in his time there were to bee ſeene in ſome cathedrall Churches the cuppes wherewith they miniſtred vnto the people, and that they were called <hi>ministring cuppes:</hi> likewiſe in the <hi>Romiſh pontificall,</hi> which were couered, and of the weight of ſome 480. or 560. ounces: hauing a certaine pretie little beake or pipe, at which the people did drinke to auoid all ſhedding. And name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, there is to bee read of that of the cathedrall Church of Mentz, and of that of the Abbye of S. Gall in Swiſſerland. And as yet to this day in the Abbye of Clugni at the great Maſſe, the Prieſt doth conſecrate three hoſtes, the one whereof, they ſay is for himſelfe, and the others for the Deacon and Subdeacon; which being receiued, hee drinketh in the cuppe one parte of the conſecrated wine with a hollow reede or pipe; and then after him his Deacon and Subdeacon, one after another doe drinke the reſt with the ſame reede or pipe. And the Chriſtians called Maronicks of the Citie Marcinas in Syria, remaining ſtill vntill this preſent in Ieruſalem practiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now wee are come to twelue hundred yeares and more after the death of our Lord, obſeruing in all ages, and pointing out from age to age this vſe of both kinds in the Church.

But as the doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, authoriſed by the Councell of Lateran after the yeare 1200. had within a while after engendred and brought forth by conſequence the concomitancie or ioyning and coupling of the bodie and blood of Chriſt together, as alſo the daunger of ſhedding, this new concluſion followed of theſe two ouer-meaſures about the yeare 1300. <hi>That therefore it was ſufficient (ſeeing alſo that it was leſſe daungerous,) to giue
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15548:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>vnto the Laitie onelie the kind of bread.</hi> And yet hetherto it ſtoode rather by tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then by ordinance or conſtitution; for it was not yet throughlie founde out as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in certaine Churches, not in all, and the rather ſeeing the daylie reſolution of the beſt learned, was, <hi>That the Sacrament was not perfect, but vnder both kindes.</hi>

Againe, <hi>Although that vnder the kinde of wine the bodie bee receiued with the blood:
<note place="margin">Duran. l. 2. p. 2. tit. ſimili mod.</note> notwithſtanding, according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Innocent the third, the blood cannot bee drunke vnder the kinde of bread, nor the bodie is not eaten vnder the kinde of wine: becauſe that like as the blood is not eaten, nor the bodie drunken; ſo neyther is the one and the other drunke vnder the kinde of bread, nor eaten vnder the kinde of Wine, &amp;c. And this is the cauſe why</hi> he addeth <hi>in certain places after the taking of the bodie and of the blood, there is reſerued and kept behind in the cup ſome little quantitie of blood and wine powred vpon it, to the end that the other Communicantes may take it, becauſe it ſhould not bee conuenient to make ſo much blood, and becauſe alſo, that there cannot be any cup found to containe it: and notwithſtanding,</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>in manie places, men doe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with breade and wine, that is with the whole Sacrament:</hi> and this is alſo confirmed vnto vs by Thomas.

<note place="margin">Balaeus, l. 5. de vit.

Inſomuch, as that this Sacrament inſtituted by our Lord, to ſignifie in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of one and the ſame bread, and one and the ſame wine, the vnion and agreement betwixt al the ſaithfull in one bodie, would ſerue by meanes of this corruption, to ſunder and ſeparate in manifeſt and open ſhew, firſt them of the Cleargie from thoſe of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:

That it is notwithſtanding permitted the Paſtors, if they haue not made an end of the Sacraments, but onelie receiued the ſame in part, that is, if they haue not drunke all, that then they ſhould diſtribute the remainder vnto thoſe of their Pariſhioners, which are ſtrong in faith, and diſcreete perſons: <hi>Euen as</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>the Pope is wont to deale with the Deacons and Ministers, and with other perſons famous for their faith, or aduanced in dignitie and worthines, with Doctors &amp; with Kinges, or as the Church dealeth at this day, with religious perſons, or men of great place, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>wee doe not allow it them</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>generallie, neither doe we generally forbid it them: for wee know that it is reſerued of purpoſe for the Church and Prelates, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and diſtribute the cuppe vnto ſuch perſons, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet in the meane time, it hath thriuen ſo well in their fingers, as that indeed Kinges hauing kept the Charter and priuiledge of this libertie, all others haue by one meanes or other loſt and forfeyted the ſame: and yet Kinges hold not this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure (ſay they) as they are Laye-men, but as they are ſacred perſons: whereuppon we reade that the great king Frauncis demaunding the reaſons of his Diuines: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>that kings are annointed as the Prieſts be:</hi> Which thing S.

               <p>Thomas Aquinas ſheweth vs plainelie, that it was in his time,
<note place="margin">Thomas de ſacram. altar.</note> that this abuſe was brought into the Church: for in the place where Lombard had made this queſtion, <hi>Wherfore the Sacrament was receiued vnder both kindes,</hi> Thomas did propound the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: <hi>why doe not the people receiue the blood vnder the wine.</hi> And there is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, in reſpect of ſome certaine yeares; during which diſtance this ſufferance crept into the Church. Now theſe are his reaſons: firſt, That as there is neede of a more ſpeciall veſſell to put the wine in, then to put the bread in; ſo it is meet and requiſite, that it ſhould bee a more ſpeciall and ſacred perſon for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the blood, then for the receiuing of the bodie: which muſt bee expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the holie Prieſtes onelie, and not of any of the vnholie Laitie. But how ſhall thoſe wordes of Chryſoſtome then take place, where hee ſayeth: That in the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Euchariſt, there is no difference betwixt the Prieſt and the people? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That there is danger therein, leaſt the people ſhould ſhed the bloode, which was not to bee feared in receyuing of the bodie.

What other thing is this, but to reach vs that Tranſubſtantiation hath begotten concomitancie, and concomitancie the communicating vnder one kinde; and by conſequent, that the Communion vnder both, practiſed by the ſpace of twelue hundred yeares in the Church, did preſuppoſe and take for granted a farre other kinde of doctrine, then that of Tranſubſtantiation or concomitancie? But this ſaide Thomas did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in an other place, that both the kindes are the inſtitution of the Lord: for hee ſayeth expreſly:

And the third reaſon is this, becauſe of the ſauing effect that is in this Sacrament: for it ſerueth to the ſaluation of the bodie, &amp; therefore the bodie is giuen: it ſerueth to the ſaluation of the ſoule, and therefore the blood is giuen.</hi> But tell mee I pray you, how farre more fit theſe three reaſons are for to proue, that it ought to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then the other three are to proue that it ought to bee taken away?

This man then began to preach againſt the abuſes of the Romiſh Church, and namely againſt the profaning of the holy ſupper, and the taking away of the cup, contrarie to the inſtitution of Chriſt and practiſe of the Primitiue Church: and he was ſeconded herein by Ierome of Prage, and followed of many.

The very words are (let euery man iudge whether the ſpirit of Chriſt or Antichriſt did ſpeake in this Councel:) <hi>Seeing we are giuen to vnderſtand that in many Churches there is continued the adminiſtration of the Sacrament vnder both kinds vnto the laitie, wee pronounce and declare that although Ieſus Chriſt hauing ſupped, did inſtitute and miniſter this reuerend ſacrament, vnto his diſciples vnder both kinds: and that ſince then it hath been receiued</hi> a conficientibus, <hi>by thoſe which haue adminiſtred it, that is by the Prieſts, vnder both, and by the laitie vnder that onely of bread: yet notwithſtanding all this, the laudable authoritie of the holy Canons, and the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtome of the Church, hath obſerued and doth obſerue, that for the avoiding of certaine daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſcandals, this ſacrament ſhall be onely adminiſtred vnder one kind.</hi> Thus then you may ſee the Pope his Canons oppoſed to the inſtitution of Chriſt, the onely Canon and rule of all ſacraments: the Church of this time oppoſed to the Primitiue, howſoeuer it be the patterne by which all others ought to ſquare &amp; faſhion themſelues through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages. And therefore he addeth, <hi>wee commaund vnder paine of excommunication, that no Prieſt doe adminiſter the communion vnto the people, vnder both the kinds of bread and of wine,</hi> contrarie to that hee had reſerued and kept in the power of the Church and Paſtors, to iudge of the diſcretion of them to whom they were to adminiſter, as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſeene out of Thomas Waldenſis, who writ at this very ſame time: yea and it is a worke of this time which our maiſter Gerſon drew into a treatiſe againſt the hereſie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder both kinds; therby conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of hereſie both Ieſus Chriſt, the author of the ſacrament, and the whole Primitiue Church, but hee was intreated to

Auguſtine in like manner ſaith, that the bread may fall: and is hee therefore of iudgement that it ought to be cut off, and not at any time to be vſed in the ſacrament? Secondly, <hi>That it cannot be carried without daunger,</hi> neither indeed was it euer ordained to bee carried: and the Churches which carried the ſame to the ſicke, did neuer buſie or trouble their mindes with this inconuenience. Thirdly, <hi>That it might be froſen in winter, and that it might turne and become tart in ſummer.</hi> And thus it was ſubiect to do during thoſe 1200. yeares, wherein it was vſed, and yet not a word in all the old fathers to bee ſeene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe queſtions, <hi>Quid ſiaceſcat? quid ſi congeleſcat? aut computreſcat &amp;c.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That it may hurt and annoy the heart, after that ſo many people haue drunke of it:</hi> but in the Primitiue Church they vſed to communicate as oft and oftner, and in greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Fifthly, <hi>That in ſome countries wine is not to be come by, but either at a very deare rate, or otherwiſe very hardly.</hi> Neither was it leſſe deare or ſcarce amongſt the Chriſtians in the Primitiue Church. Sixtly, <hi>That whiles it was practiſed, the laitie did touch the cuppe.</hi> Where are they forbidden to touch it, ſeeing they are bidden to take it? Seuenthly, <hi>That ſome haue ouer long beards, and that other ſome haue the Palſey, &amp;c.</hi> How much more tollerable were it to cut off the beard, then the cup? and to ſupplie the infirmities of ſuch as haue the Palſey, rather then to cut off the perfection of the ſacrament? And who ſeeth not that all theſe reaſons are hatcht vnder the hen of Tranſubſtantiation, vnknowne vnto the whole Church for euer before? The eight, <hi>That the dignitie of the Prieſts and of the laitie by this ſhould be all alike:</hi> where haue they euer read that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles did make any diſtinction or difference in the ſacrament? The ninth, <hi>Men would then co nceiue that the ſacrament conſiſted more in taking of it, then in conſecrating of it; in receiuing of it, then in ſeeing of it, and thus we ſhould come back again from our pretended ſacrifice vnto the ſacrament.</hi> And who can doubt hereof, ſeeing our Lorde hath ſaid: <hi>Take, eate, drinke, &amp;c.</hi> The tenth, <hi>Euerie man will iudge, if it ſhall be giuen to the people, that then it will be alwaies neceſſary and needfull.</hi> And what more vrgent and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable neceſsitie can there bee, then for the diſciples of Chriſt to fulfil the wil of their maiſter? Laſtly, <hi>That then the Church of Rome ſhould haue failed in the ſacraments, and the Councell of Conſtance in the matter of faith and manners, whereuppon would followe a contemning of the Church, and conſequently a ſchiſme in Chriſtendome.</hi> Now heere indeed is the ſore and pinching griefe: and it is for nothing elſe but for the top of honour, that all this contention falleth out. But how much better had it beene to haue bewailed and wept for the fault committed, when they heard the cocke crow? And doe we not ſee how God hath curſed all theſe reaſons bent vpon the ſetting vppe of a pompe and ſtatelineſſe, and not to the eſtabliſhing of the Church? when as vnder pretence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of a pretended ſchiſme, they haue made themſelues odious and abhominable vnto the greateſt part of Chriſtendome? But our worthie maiſter Gerſon, doeth take the checke, and is offended at this clauſe of <hi>Notwithſtanding,</hi> and therefore ſetteth his wits vpon the racke, to find out ſome others, but no leſſe blaſphemous, then thoſe alleadged by the good foreſaide fathers, were ſottiſh and ridiculous, <hi>That the cup had no ground in the word of God, and that it was not of the neceſsitie of the ſacrament? That it was not appointed or ordained for any but the Apoſtles, and in them for the Prieſts: That men muſt not hold ſo much of the ſcripture, as they muſt of the traditions of the Church;</hi> that is, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Cuſanus ſaith in his ſecond epiſtle to the Bohemians, <hi>That the inſtitution of the ſcripture doeth change in time, and apply it ſelfe vnto the ceremonie that is currant and receiued
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15548:65"/>in the church,</hi> Secundum currentem ritum eccleſiae. But the ſtrongeſt of all the reſt, and that which alreadie hath beene practiſed in that place, is, that in this point, <hi>Viendum eſt</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>brachio ſeculari contra refragantes, that is, there muſt the ſecular power bee ſtretched out, and puniſhment with all hote purſute bee executed vpon thoſe that will not obeye vnto this Canon:</hi> neuer trobling the braine with diſputing and arguing aboute the matter, and that the Emperour muſt bee exhorted to put his helping hand thereto freelie and willinglie.</p>
               <p>But it is not to bee belieued, how much blood hath beene ſhed in Bohemia, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauia, and other Prouinces, for the taking away of the blood of Chriſt from the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Pope will haue obedience what price ſoeuer it coſt; the people to keepe this pretious pledge of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, freelie expoſing themſelues to loſſe of goods and life.

<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. Heb. 3. Iohn 6.

The word ſufficeth, what neede haue I of the Sacraments? if it were not that wee did giue that reuerend and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an regarde vnto the inſtitution of Chriſt, to bound and limit all our concluſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tearmes of the ſame. In the meane time it curſeth all them which hold that the Communion vnder the two kinds is neceſſarie, either in reſpect of ſaluation, or otherwiſe in reſpect of the commaundement of God: as all thoſe likewiſe which ſay, that the cuppe hath beene taken from the Laitie without anie manner of ſounde ground or ſufficient reaſons: and as for the ſute and requeſt amde by Princes, that it might bee reſtored to them and their Subiectes; they commit that to the Pope alone for to decide and aunſwere, together with the aduiſe of diuerſe Biſhoppes: and in euerie caſe they ſend vnto him certaine conditions and articles, whereto hee is admoniſhed to binde them, by whome hee ſhall bee wonne and ouercome; and theſe articles are ſuch as are not contained in the Decrees of the Councell, but were then retained <hi>in mente Curiae,</hi> and were afterwarde communicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaide Princes.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Paſtors and preachers vnto thoſe nations or people to whom the vſe of the cup ſhall be graunted, doe beleeue and teach that the cuſtome of communicating vnder one kinde, is not againſt the ſacred inſtitution of the Lard, but rather laudable and worthie to bee obſerued &amp; kept as a law, if the Church ordain not otherwiſe. That ſuch as teach or beleeue otherwiſe are hereticks: and that they ſhall not adminiſter vnder both kindes vnto any but ſuch as ſhal both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and confeſse the ſame.</hi> But and if this be to applie themſelues onely to the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the people, that they thus giue place and yeeld vnto them in this their requeſt, then what a hell is that, to force and violently to wreſt this profeſsion from them, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their infirmitie; by this meanes offering them one fauour with the left hand, and in the meane while drawing twentie from them with the right?</p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>That they ſhall promiſe to acknowledge the Pope to be the lawfull Paſtour and Biſhop of the vniuerſall Church, yeelding to him as dutifull children, all manner of reuerence, from a free and loyall heart.</hi> Who will beleeue that ſuch things did euer come from the Apoſtles? or who will beleeue that Saint Peter before that euer hee would graunt the ſacrament to the faithfull, had gone about to draw ſuch an oath &amp; homage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them? And againe, who doth not ſee that they ſell the blood of Chriſt to the people? yea the ſame blood which Chriſt himſelfe did ſo freely and without any price ſhed for them, doe they not make them buy with the high price of the ſeruitude of their ſoules? and not of their ſoules onely, but of the whole Church? yea and of the truth it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>But in as much as theſe conditions ſeemed vnto the Princes and Eſtates too hard and heauie a yoake, and too much ouerlaid with tyrannie, it was thought good that things ſhould ſtand and continue altogether in ſuch ſtate as was graunted and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſent of the Councell. And let them not maruaile any more at that which Luther ſaid; <hi>That it was wiſedome to be well aduiſed and warie in taking any thing that the Pope ſhall yeeld and agree vnto: namely, ſeeing that for to take away one abuſe, hee would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie aime at and ſtand for the eſtabliſhing of all others how many ſoeuer.</hi> And it ſtandeth him vpon, ſeeing that of all the Chriſtian Churches that are, whether Greeke, Ruſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Syrian, Armenian, or Abiſsine, &amp;c. there is not ſo much as one, but the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is adminiſtred therein vnder both kindes: and contrariwiſe, the adminiſtration thereof vnder one kinde diſallowed and condemned.

Indeed thoſe ſacraments were figures and types of this, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of the true bread, which was to come downe from heauen; the lambe of the true lambe, which ſhould beare and take vpon him the ſinnes of the worlde; in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of whom we are ſaued.

So then, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme comming in place of circumciſion, becauſe that in circumciſion men were cut and not waſhed: ſhould it follow that in Baptiſme men ſhould be cut, ſeeing they were ſo in circumciſion? or elſe that it ſhould not be needfull to waſh in Baptiſme, becauſe in circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion there was no waſhing?

That of Conſtance guided (as they ſay) by the holy ghoſt, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and proclaimeth with a loude voice, <hi>That although Ieſus Chriſt haue inſtituted the Sacraments vnder both kinds, when he gaue it to his diſciples: &amp; although the Primitiue Church hath ſo distributed it vnto the faithfull, &amp;c.</hi> In briefe, Ieſus Chriſt did either ſpeake vnto his Apoſtles alone; or elſe in their perſons, to all the faithful, or to the Prieſtes onely. To his Apoſtles alone it cannot be auouched: for it is written, <hi>Doe yee this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me; Declare the death of the Lord vntill his comming.</hi> Vnto the Prieſts alone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the names of the Apoſtles; but what apparant ſhew or likelyhood is there of that? For the Apoſtles in this action, <hi>Non erant conficientes, ſed ſumentes, they did not occupie the places of Prieſts, but of the faithfull,</hi> not of Paſtors, but of ſheepe. And to take it then at the hardeſt, Ieſus Chriſt hauing ſpoken vnto them, whom they call <hi>non conficientes,</hi> and hauing commaunded them to take the cup, it ſhould follow, that the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God doeth of neceſsitie charge them to communicate vnder both kindes, which is directly contrarie to the Article of the Councel of Trent: which ſaieth, <hi>Clericos non conficientes non obligari ad viramque ſpeciem, &amp;c. That Clarks themſelues not conſecrating the hoſt, are not bound to receiue vnder both kinds.</hi> It remaineth then that thoſe wordes are ſpoken vnto them, as being faithful; and ſo repreſenters of al other Chriſtian people, that is to ſay, that Ieſus Chriſt as the houſholder and maiſter or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour of the church hath diſpenſed &amp; diſtributed the Euchariſt vnto his diſciples; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15548:67"/>ordained and inſtituted it for them which did beleeue their word, that is, his owne; and that hee did appoint them to diſtribute vnto them, euery one in his place, that which they had receiued at his hands.

But aſſuredly the Euangeliſt doth ſhew it plainly enough in the words that follow; <hi>likewiſe alſo he tooke the cup, &amp;c.</hi> that if theſe words <hi>Doe this, &amp;c.</hi> haue relation to the bread: that then by the ſame proportion they are to be vnderſtood of the cup.
<note place="margin">1.

But his intent and drift is more manifeſt in theſe wordes: <hi>In as much as they haue loued hospitalitie, they haue knowne in the breaking of bread him, whom they could not knowan the expounding of the Scriptures.</hi> Then followeth S. Auguſtine his concluſion: <hi>Let no man thinke that hee knoweth Chriſt, if he be not a partaker of his bodie, that is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the church, the vnitie whereof the Apoſtle recommendeth vnto vs in the ſacrament of bread, when he ſaith, we are all one bread and one bodie, &amp;c.</hi> And in deed, Lyranus doth neceſſarily inferre of theſe words of S. Auguſtine, that it muſt not be vnderſtood of the naturall, but of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall bodie of Chriſt, which is the Church. And their owne Doctors likewiſe at this time do iarre and diſagree about this place of S. Luke. For as Belarmine confeſſeth, Iohn of Louaine would haue it vnderſtood of the Euchariſt, and would alſo fit S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine to his humor. Cornelius Ianſenius is of the contrarie iudgement, and reſteth ſatiſfied in himſelfe, in taking it for a figure of the Euchariſt, and not the thing it ſelfe. And he proueth his collection out of the place of Saint Auguſtine aboue named, by Beda, Theophilact, Innocent the third, &amp;c. But in the end what manner of diuinity will this come to be, by a place verie intricate &amp; doubtfull, to ouerthrow that which is grounded vppon verie many moſt plaine and pregnant places? by the ſtorie of a matter paſſed and done in an Inne, the preſcript and preciſe inſtitution of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the aſſemblie of his Apoſtles? And what will they ſay to Lyranus, who ſaith, that S. Luke was one of theſe trauelling pilgrims?

<note place="margin">Act. 2. &amp; 24.</note> And this is proued by the Actes: for there it is ſaid, that they did communicate in the breaking of bread. In deed ſome of the old writers do vnderſtand it of the Euchariſt; others of the ſocietie and brotherly fellowſhip that was amongſt the Apoſtles, but neuer a one of them all of the communicating of the ſacrament vnder one kind. But Chryſoſtome &amp; all the Greeke expoſitors, collected into one by Oecumenius, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete it of the ſober diet, which they vſed being come together.

<note place="margin">Act. 27.</note> They had beene four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies vpon the ſea without eating: S.

Whereto doeth all this diſcourſe and all theſe circumſtances carrie vs, but vnto an ordinarie manner of taking of meate? Wherefore ſhould that be a ſacrament vnto S.

And if it were but for himſelfe, was he not then alſo <hi>Conſiciens, that is, he that conſecrated it?</hi> And wherefore then did he not communicate but vnder one kind alone; that is to ſay, why would he commit yet a ſecond ſacriledge? If it were not yet further, that they would drawe from hence, their goodly inſtitution, of not being able to ſay any other but dry Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whiles they are a ſhipboard at ſea? But and if they ſay that he bleſſed it, that hee gaue thankes, who can make any other thing hereof, but that he onely did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the laudable manner of the Iewes, who neuer take either bread or wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this bleſſing? <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord that giueth vs, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, the ordinary Gloſſe ſaith in that place: <hi>He tooke bread, that he might be an example to others to do the like:</hi> Et gratias egit, <hi>he gaue thankes:</hi> Iuxta morem ſolitum in comedendo, <hi>according to their wonted cuſtome in eating:</hi> Et cum fregiſſet, coepit manducare; <hi>and hauing broken it he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to eate:</hi> Exhortationis verbo <hi>(ſaith it)</hi> &amp; operis exemplo, <hi>in the word of exhortation and example of worke, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame which Oecumenius ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Finally, they renounce the Canonicall ſcriptures, and flie for refuge vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha; they let go ſound and authentike hiſtories, to take hold of fabulous tales. It is read (ſay they) in the Goſpell according to the Hebrewes, that our Lord after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection gaue the Euchariſt vnto Iames the Iuſt vnder one kind.

But let not vs forget their manifold contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ordinarie traine attending vpon falſe doctrine. For ſometimes they ſay, that the Iewes did not drinke in their ſacrifices, &amp; from thence would draw a conſequence for the holy Supper. Sometimes they alleadge this place of Exodus; how that after that the people had ſacrificed to the golden calfe, they ſate downe to eat &amp; to drink. Alſo, it was (ſay they) left indifferent in the primitiue Churches,
<note place="margin">Verga de Euch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> to communicate the ſacrament vnder one onely kind, or vnder both, and as it were with one breath they by and by againe auouch the contrary. As that two were ordained for the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Idem Verga</note> and but one for the Iewes: as being a people that loathed wine in their ſacrifices; &amp; neither the one nor the other grounded vpon the ſcriptures. Againe, the two kinds were inſtituted for the Gentiles: and yet in the turning of a hand they go and exclude the laitie, and allow them vnto the prieſts onely. Againe, ſometimes they ſay,
<note place="margin">Verg. &amp; Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</note> that the vſe of the one kinde is come from the Apoſtles: and a little after they ſay, that the Church did ordaine it againſt the Neſtorians, who did not confeſſe or admit of concomitancie, where of notwithſtanding the eccleſiaſticall hiſtories doe not ſpeake a word. In briefe, in one place they ſay, that <hi>Hoc facite, do this in remembrance of mee,</hi> reſpecteth both the kindes: and in another that properly it muſt bee reſtrained vnto the bread, as meant thereof onely: for it (ſay they) was giuen a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yea and was diſgeſted before that our Lord had diſtributed the cup. And thus you may ſee how in parting the kinds of the ſacrament, or rather the ſignes, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them a ſunder, they are rent and diuided one from another, and euery man in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And as for the practiſe of the old Church, when they are not able to deny it, yet they will not ceaſe to extenuate and diminiſh the ſame: The Councell of Trent eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in theſe wordes: <hi>Licet in Primitiua eccleſia vtriuſ<expan>

<note place="margin">Latomus.</note> vntill the time of the Councel of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Others ſay, that the Primitiue Church being as yet rude and dull of conceit,
<note place="margin">Latomus.</note> did obſerue moſt religiouſly, the inſtitution of Chriſt: but that afterward ſhe learned of the fathers, that the two kindes were for the prieſtes, and not for the laitie:
<note place="margin">Bellarminus.</note> a learned ignoraunce and eloquent rudenes, to keepe themſelues to the law of their maiſter, but an ignorant learning, and rude vnderſtanding to depart from the ſame and leaue it. Others ſay, that the courſe was good whiles there were but a few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but that after there grew to be ſuch great concourſe and flocking, it was no good order: and by this goodly reaſon they would cleare themſelues of all the olde fathers. But what will they ſay to Tertullian, who ſaith:
<note place="margin">Tertul. in Apol.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue filled your cities and your fieldes, your pallaces and your armies: where is the empire that can withſtand vs, if our doctrine did not carrie with it the doctrine rather of dying, then of killing?</hi> And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this people did receiue the communion vnder both kinds.

And to the conuerſion of the nations vnto Ieſus Chriſt, all which intirely and wholy we read to haue receiued both kinds? I meane the citties, prouinces, nations, and armies, yea and that in the wide open field? whereas we ſee on the contrarie that this cuſtome came in when Chriſtendome beganne to decline and fall away from her firſt

               <p>They ſay,
<note place="margin">What the laye mans commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is.</note> yea wee do ordinarily reade in the old writers, <hi>Communionem laicam, the communion of the laeitie:</hi> that was this which is adminiſtred vnder one kinde. This guile and craftie ſhift is too plaine and manifeſt, the diſtinction and difference of the laitie and of the Clearkes, is well inough knowne what it meant in the old Church: theſe being ſuch as were to take charge in the miniſterie vpon them, as to be Paſtors, Elders, Deacons, Subdeacons, &amp;c. and thoſe to be ſuch ſimplie as were faithfull, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and led by the miniſterie of the others. Now the old Church, that they might the better containe and kepe ſuch as had charge of the diſpenſing of the word in the performance of their dutie, did hold them vnder a more ſtraite and ſeuere kind of diſcipline: and if it had happened, that any one of them had ſwarued in the confeſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, or grieuouſly failed in any parte of his dutie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the qualitie and meaſure of his fault, he was ſuſpended from his miniſterie, or els he was wholy depriued and put from the ſame, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer acknowledgement of the ſame that he made: reſerued notwithſtanding their libertie to be receiued into the Chriſtian ſocietie, and to communicate in the ſacraments, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of other faithfull people, that is of the laitie: but not to diſpence or diſtribute the ſacraments in the charge &amp; place which before they had inioyed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet to communicate amongſt them of the cleargie.

<note place="margin">Cypr. 2 cp. ad Stephanum.</note> and to be ſimply a ſheepe and not a ſhepheard. And Cyprian layeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter open in more plaine ſort writing vnto Stephanus: <hi>If there be any Elders or Deacons</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which hauing beene ordained in the Catholike church, are become rebellious, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying themſelues diſloyally or vndutifully towards her, &amp;c. we adde and ſet downe this by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon authoritie, that if they repent,</hi> communicent laici, <hi>that is, let them be receiued into the communion of the Church, as laye people, and let them reſt ſatiſfied that they are receiued into the peace of the church, hauing beene the enemies thereof: but not to heare armes or any enſigne of ordination or honour, ſeeing they haue abuſed them to rebellion againſt her, that is, that which commonly they call Orders, &amp;c.</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, let them bee receiued into the church, to receiue the Euchariſt with the faithfull, but not to bleſſe and diſtribute it.

Adde hereunto, that all theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are of the ſame time, wherein as we haue proued, all the faithfull did receiue both kinds. And it is nothing to the purpoſe that Bellarmine ſaith, that theſe canons doe ſpeake for the moſt part of Deacons, to whom it did not belong to conſecrate. For beſides that he ſpeaketh there of Biſhops alſo, he doth not deale onely with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe office ſerueth to conſecrate, but with all maner of perſons hauing charge in the Church: beſides that it was the ordinary function of the Deacons to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the cup. As little conſequence is there in that which he gathereth of that, that the ambitious Bbs. at the requeſt of Oſius were not receiued to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the laie people, no not vnto the death: which is likewiſe affirmed afterward of all haynous crimes: for the ſeueritie of the old Church did excommunicate all ſuch as had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any criminall treſpaſſe, from the holy ſupper,
<note place="margin">Concil. Sardic. c. 1.</note> for the reuerence they had of the ſacrament, and deteſtation of malefactors, according to the qualitie of their offences; for ten yeares, for twentie yeares, for the whole time of life, and ſometimes ſo as that they would not giue it them, no not to the death. Whereupon at this time riſeth that practiſe which wee ſee, of not giuing it to ſuch as are conuicted of any enormous crimes, nor vnto thoſe which are going to execution. But in the meane time they lay amongſt the penitentes, in a place ſeperated both from the Cleargie and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And of them if they bee laye people, ſpeake the Councels: <hi>Ne in fine quidem iis communionem dandam, that they ſhould not haue the communion, no not to their dying day.</hi> If they were Clearkes, then there is added: <hi>no not the Communion amongst the laitie,</hi> Ne laicam quidem: for tenne, twentie, thirtie yeares, yea not to death. And when they did graunt it vppon the manifeſtation of their repentance, and ſhedding of their aboundant ſtore of teares, yet it was not to any other effect, but to accompt and take them as laye men, without any inabling of them to their former places of dignitie, that ſo the Miniſters of the Church might bee the better brideled and kept in the doing of their duties. For as for that which Bellarmine ſayeth: That there was nothing giuen them but bread, becauſe they durſt not touch the cuppe: what appearance of truth is there in it, that they ſhould take the bread in their hand; a thing that ſome doe agree vnto, and durſt not touch the cuppe? that they durſt not touch the veſſell, and yet touched the Sacrament? Againe, what puniſhment had it beene to giue the bodie and not the blood, and the bodie according to their concomitancie, which extendeth to the containing of the blood? And had not this rather beene an iniurie to the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then a puniſhment to the crime? In briefe, it is apparant by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that both the one and the other was giuen to the ſicke. Iuſtinus ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iuſt. in Apol.</note> that the one and the other was carried to thoſe that were abſent.

<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 5.</note> but vnto them which were neare vnto death, hauing beene ſuſpended from the Sacraments, as may bee ſeene in the hiſtorie of Serapio, that ſo there might effectually be declared vnto them their reconciliation with God, and their peace with the Church, to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of their conſciences, vpon their departure out of this life into another, which otherwiſe ſhould haue beene diuerſly toſſed and perplexed in this agonie;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15548:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>dying vnder the cenſure of the Church. To this purpoſe S. Cyprian ſaith: <hi>In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame perill of death, the excommunicate must not ſtay till he be reconciled by the Biſhop, but let him teſtifie his vnfained repentance before the Deacon,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. ep. 180</note> and ſo depart in peace.</hi> Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine: <hi>When it is come to that point</hi> (ſay they) <hi>they runne to the Church, ſome deſire to bee baptized: others to bee reconciled: others, the testiſying of their repentance, &amp;c. And if the Miniſters faile, into what daunger do they caſt them which depart from the church, either not baptiſed, or bound with the cenſures eccleſiaſticall?</hi> But the hiſtorie of Serapio cleareth this matter. In the time of perſecution he had ſacrificed to an Idoll; the Church had excommunicated him, deliuering him vp vnto Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then he was as a heathen &amp; ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, ſhut out not only from the communion of the ſacraments, but from the ſocietie of Chriſtians. Hauing in the end beſeeched his brethren with teares, hee fell ſicke through ſorrow and heauines of heart, loſing his ſpeech within three daies, which he recouered againe vpon the fourth, and ſaid: <hi>How long will ye hold me in this caſe? bring me hither a miniſter, that I may be reconciled vnto God, and reſtored vnto the church before I die.</hi> And then the ſacraments were adminiſtred vnto him, in token that the Church was at peace with him againe.</p>

               <p>And now by this time wee haue looked into all the partes thereof,
<note place="margin">A Recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> how and by what degrees the holy Supper of our Lord is degenerate and turned into the Maſſe: how of the corrupting of the one, the other was firſt begotten, then nouriſhed: and afterward brought vp to that ſtate wherein it hath ſtood for theſe certaine ages, and that ſo long, as vntill it hath vtterly brought the other to nothing in the Church of Rome: So ſtraunge an alteration, as that in the whole frame and booke of nature there is not the like to bee met withall: ſeeing the Maſſe now retaineth no more of the holy Supper, either in his outward or inward partes: ſeeing that the beſt ſighted, hauing conſidered the one, could not obſerue or find ſo much as one ſtep or note of the other: becauſe alſo, it is to go againſt and exceede the lawes of nature, to paſſe from one extremitie to another: a thing not credible, not poſſible to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if the diligent obſeruation of hiſtories did not point out vnto vs both the firſt proceedings, and alſo the growing of the ſame, till it came at the midſt. The holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was an aſſemblie, a bodie of the faithfull, vnited and knit together in one ſpirite, ſtrengthning the faith; ſtirring vp the charity; and kindling the zeale one of another: in one common manner of celebrating of the ſeruice of God. The Maſſe what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it, being ſaid by a prieſt, in ſome corner of the church, &amp; ſhuffled vp by a cleark who vnderſtandeth not for the moſt part of the time, one word that he ſpeaketh? The holy ſupper did reſound with ſongs to the praiſe of God, ſung indifferently by all the people: it taught them by the reading &amp; expounding of the holy ſcriptures: it lifted them vp vnto God, &amp; raiſed them out of themſelues by feruent &amp; ardent praier. But what impreſſion can the Maſſe make in the heartes of men? being a certaine kind of muttering noiſe, poſted ouer by one man alone, not vnderſtood of thoſe which are preſent, yea hardly vnderſtood of himſelfe, where the ſcriptures are read of purpoſe, ſo as they may not be vnderſtood: the praiers vttered with a low voice, in an vnknown tongue, that ſo they may not be heard with attention, and leſſe followed deuoutly by the people, where by conſequent they abide fixt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which they ſee, not minding any higher matters: it hath ſignes, without any ſignification: it hath pretended my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, without any thing miſticall in them, except it be the muttered hums, artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected by him that conſecrateth, and the carefull regard of a premeditated ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to be wrought and effected by ſuch meanes vpon and in the poore ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In the holy Supper was celebrated the memory of the death and paſſion of our Lord, by a plaine and open rehearſall of the cauſe, manner, and benefites of the ſame: and thereby the faithfull were taught to acknowledge and call to minde the greatneſſe of their ſinnes, and to admire and magnifie the great and vnſpeakeable mercies of God, ſtirred vp conſequently to renounce and forſake themſelues, to giue themſelues vnto God, to die vnto their luſts and concupiſcences, to liue vnto Chriſt: to Chriſt I ſay, who hauing once deliuered himſelfe to the death of the Croſſe, for to giue them life, did yet further vouchſafe to giue himſelfe to them in his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes euerie day, as meate and drinke vnto their ſoules, to the feeding of them vp vnto eternall life. In the Maſſe I appeale vnto the conſciences of all thoſe that eyther ſay or ſee the ſame, who of them it is that can ſay by being at the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie daye, that hee can learne or carrie away any of all this; that the infidell
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15548:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>can thence playe the diuine; that thence hee can receiue any inſtruction, either of the deadly fall of Adam, or of the quickning death of Chriſt; that the Chriſtian can profit therby any thing be it neuer ſo little, in the true acknowledging of the mercies of God; or in the knowledge of himſelfe, or in briefe that he can therein perceiue his tranſgreſſions, that ſo he may run to ſeeke the remedie: or this drynes &amp; alteration of the ſoule and mind, which our Lord calleth the thirſt of righteouſnes, to quench the ſame in the welſpring of life, this reuiuing water, guſhing out vnto eternall life, this precious blood of our Lord, which is made our iuſtification, yea our iuſtice? Againe, in the holy Supper all the faithfull did communicate together in bread and in the cuppe, in the bodie, and in the blood of our Lord: being taught thereby, that they were but one bodie, euen the bodie of Chriſt; but diuers members, quickened, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and gouerned by one ſpirite, euen by his ſpirit: liuing one life, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught mutually to loue one another, mutually to imbrace one another: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomming ſeruants to the leſſer, the ſtrong vnto the weake, the learned to the ignorant, and the wiſe and prudent to the fooliſh and ſimple, referring all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the glorie of their head, to the ſeruice of the bodie, and to the ſaluation of his members. In the Maſſe, what is there that may imprint this brotherly loue and charitie in vs, or expreſſe and teach vs any ſuch inſtruction? yea on the contrarie, which doth not ſuppreſſe and burie charitie, which doth not oppreſſe and ſmother, &amp; that in all diſpightfull manner ſuch leſſons and doctrine? where the Prieſt (if hee may be lawfully ſo called) communicateth alone, one for all: where the auncient bread of the communion of the bodie of Chriſt: great, according to the proportion of the communicants, is brought to one wafer, &amp; that in ſome places no greater then a penie, being for the prieſt alone; whereas our Lord deliuered himſelfe to death for all, and gaue himſelfe to all: where alſo ſo oft as any are admitted thereunto, they are depriued of the cup, of the communion, ſo much as in them lyeth, of the blood of Chriſt. Then what proportion holdeth it with the ſupper? yea, what oppoſition and contrarietie is there, that it maintaineth not againſt the Apoſtle: <hi>We are one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.17.</note> and one onely bodie, &amp;c.</hi> To be ſhort, in the holy ſupper, man was taught how he was indebted vnto one onely God for his creation, as likewiſe that hee was not bound to any for the work of his regeneration, iuſtification, ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſaluation, but to one only Chriſt the eternall ſon of God, the beginning, midſt, and end of our ſpirituall life: in ſo much as that he which doth regenerate vs in baptiſme, and doth nouriſh and feed vs in the holy ſupper, is made our meat himſelfe, and in ſo much as that he which waſheth vs from our ſinnes, doth cloath and couer vs with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. In the Maſſe what ſhall wee ſay? where of the holy table of our Lord, they haue made vs an Altar of all ſortes of ſaints: where of the remembrance of his death, they haue made vs a legend of the Saintes, their ſufferinges and paſſions: where, in ſtead of his blood, the onely propitiation for our ſinnes, they pretend to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto vs their praiers, interceſſions and merites: where, to ſhut vp all in a word, is pretended to ſacrifice in honor of the Saints, him, for whoſe glorie and names ſake all the Saintes haue offered whatſoeuer they haue ſacrificed, yea and for whoſe names ſake they ought to ſacrifice themſelues. To bee ſhort, let vs ſet before vs on the one ſide an aſſemblie of faithfull people praying vnto God, ſinging his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hearing his worde, and attentiue to the expounding of the ſame: a ſeruant of God in all ſimplicitie, ſo ripping vp their ſinnes, as that hee maketh them to haue a ſence and feeling of the ſame by the worde, declaring thereupon the remiſſion thereof in the death and paſſion of our Lorde, diſtributing vnto them rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the table, his bodie and his blood, in the ſacrament of bread and wine, which he hath inſtituted, and prouoking and ſtirring of them vp to the giuing of all heartie and euerlaſting praiſe vnto him for this ſo great a benefite: This was the holy ſupper of the faithfull in the old Church: this is ours. And now ſet before your eyes on the other ſide a Prieſt with a ſtraunge garment, his face fixt vppon an Altar, with a Clearke ſtanding behind him, muttering in an vnknowne language, interlarded
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15548:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>with ſignes, lifting vppe a Wafer in an affected and ceremoniall ſorte, cauſing it to bee worſhipped; dippping it in his wine, eating it alone, vſing no word of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation or exhortation, neither yet giuing the people any other taſte thereof by any manner of inſtruction; perſwading them notwithſtanding, that by thus much as hath beene done, being at their or his requeſt, and bought with ſome peece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he hath ſacrificed our Lord for them or him, that hee hath with this his one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſet his father in Paradice, drawne him out of Purgatorie, &amp;c. This is the Maſſe of Rome: that ſame which wee ſo greatly complaine of, and whereof there is ſo much talke: but how differing and diſagreeing both for manner and effect (I call their owne ſoules to witnes) from the ſeruice of the fathers? how farre off then from the inſtitution of Chriſt, and how farre off from the order of the Apoſtles? But it is now time to finiſh this diſcourſe: let vs leaue the partes, and looke into the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and ſo we ſhall come to behold the truth of this matter in more cleare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident manner.</p>

As alſo by Euſebius, who ſaith, that the places wherein they prayed, were caues and dennes, as hauing made them places for to pray in: whereas on the contrarie our Sauiour Chriſt reproueth and reprocheth the Phariſies, for that of the places of praiers they had made dennes for theeues. Tertullian ſheweth vs that in his time they had no where to aſſemble and come together, but in ſimple and ſilly houſes, where he ſaith: <hi>The houſe of our doue is but a ſimple one, ſcituate in high places, &amp; daily inuaded and beſet.</hi> This was about the yeare 200. &amp; their firſt publike aſſemblies were in the places where they vſed to burie the Martyrs. So wee reade, that in the time of Valerian, Aemilianus, gouern or of Egypt, defendeth the exerciſe of religion in the Chriſtians of Alexandria, by theſe words: <hi>You are vnthankefull for the mildnes and lenitie of the Emperors, &amp;c. you are not like to hold and inioy your Synodes and aſsemblies in the places of buriall of your Martyrs any longer.</hi> And it is ſaid of Galerius: <hi>That hee may spoile vs and bring vs to nothing, he will take away from vs the libertie of our aſſemblies, in the places of the buriall of our Martyrs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 6, c. 3.</note> But contrariwiſe of Galienus: <hi>That he reſtored them the places of the buriall of their Martyrs, to the end that they might celebrate the diuine ſeruice:</hi> that is, ſaith Onuphrius, baptiſings, the holy Supper, and ſermons, &amp;c. But in time they began to build and erect certaine ſlight manner of buildings to defend them againſt the iniuries of the weather, and them they called frames. And this is attributed to Fabianus a Biſhop of Rome, and a Martyr by Damaſus. And hereby is ſeene the impudencie of thoſe men, which haue imagined and deuiſed theſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legendes; wherein is reported, that Sauinian did build a temple vnto Saint Peter in his life time: and Alexander the firſt another which hee called <hi>Advincula.</hi> And Hyginus ordained, that temples ſhould not be dedicated without Maſſe, &amp; that the ſtuffe brought into the place to build withall, ſhould not be conuerted vnto profane vſes, &amp;c. All ſuch as liued in the heat and raging times of perſecution, being more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to build the Church by their death, then by any ſuch monuments which might be the remembrauncers of their life. After the yeare 200. at certaine ſpaces of time which fell out calme, they aſſembled more freely, and builded more ſolide and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall places of praier, and that in Citties, in the time of Alexander Seuerus, Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus,

Together with exceſſe in buildings,
<note place="margin">The dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> there entred into the Church the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of dedications, taken from the Iewiſh rites; for the ſimplicitie of Chriſtianitie knew no ſuch thing, and that which wee reade in the Epiſtle of Clement vnto Saint Iames, is very friuolous: for ſeeing there was no Temples in their time, it could not poſſibly come to paſſe, that there ſhould bee any dedicating of them. But as Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon had dedicated the Temple by a ſolemne prayer, which hee vttered and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his owne mouth in the preſence of all the people; Conſtantine conſecrated the Citty of Conſtantinople vnto God in the preſence of the Fathers of the Councell of Nice: the Temple of the holy Sepulcher at Ieruſalem,
<note place="margin">Euſeb l. 4. de vit. Conſtant. Athanaſ. Apo. 2.</note> before them that were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the Councell of Tyre. And this manner of conſecration was performed by ſolemne prayer, and in homilies and exhortations taken out of the word of God; as alſo in the celebrating of the holie Supper, then with a publike and generall ioye and reioycing, in large and bountifull giftes from the Prince, and ſuch like things. But as for holy water and all ſuch odde trumperies as are vſed at this day, there was not a worde: but as the authoritie of Biſhoppes grew, ſo they drew vnto themſelues this power and facultie of dedicating Temples. And thereupon it is that Gelaſius his Decree came forth a little before the yeare 500.
<note place="margin">26. q. 5. De Conſe. 1. C. Nemo.

But thoſe whome they worſhip are dead: but not content therewith, they ſet vp their images to bee worſhipped, which in deed cannot poſsiblie die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were neuer aliue: And thus man goeth a whoring from the true and onely God, as a common harlot, prostituting her ſelfe to euerie mans couch and companie, &amp;c.

And therefore the Gospell armeth you againſt this errour, when hee ſaith: What haue I to do with thee O woman? as it were thereby propheſying of the ſectes and hereſies which ſhould riſe thereupon in the world, leaſt that any doting vpon, or too deepe falling in loue with her holines, might be plunged into the pit of this rauing and ſenceles madnes of foule and filthie hereſie, &amp;c. But ſhe is honourable and renowned as Elias, as Iohn the Euangeliſt, &amp;c. yea and more renowned by reaſon of the dispenſation of the myſterie, for which ſhe was thought to be a fit and worthy inſtrument: but yet not ſo worthy as to bee worſhipped and adored no more then the other. For farre be it from vs, that we ſhould euer be ouertaken with that old errour of leauing and forſaking of the liuing God, to fal a worſhipping of the things which he hath made. For if he will not haue any man to worſhip the Angels, how much leſſe her that was borne of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which was giuen by Ioachim to Anna, begotten of the ſeed of man and woman, after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie courſe of all other men and women, &amp;c. Let not Marie then go without her due honour, but let vs bow before and worſhip the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt: let no perſon, whether man or woman worſhip and bow before Marie. This myſterie is due vnto the one onely God: the Angels looke not for any ſuch glorie: let vs blot out all ſuch abuſes as haue beene curſedly carued and written in our hearts: let vs take from before our eyes the coueting of wood: and let euery creature turne and apply themſelues to him which hath made them.</hi> Now he which ſpeaketh thus of the Virgine Marie herſelfe, what would he then haue ſaid of the Saints? what would he haue ſaid of her image and theirs?

And as for ſuch people as doe ſet vp their images, what profite I pray you, can they report vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that they reape thereby? Is it becauſe they would after a certaine manner and ſorte bee put in mind of them by looking vpon them?

               </p>
               <p>Nowe this is to come to that which Eraſmus ſaith in his Catechiſme;
<note place="margin">Eraſm. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techeſ. &amp; in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſt. l. 2.</note> that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the time of Saint Ierome, and as wee ſee ſomewhat later, images were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of them which were of the beſt approued religion, no not the image of Chriſt himſelfe. And therefore, after he hath turned himſelfe round, that he might applie himſelfe vnto the time, yet notwithſtanding hee commeth to conclude: <hi>That there is neyther law of God nor man, which ordaineth images in Temples. And that it is both more eaſie and more ſure to take them all away, then to go about to deale with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they would vſe them ſparingly, or to preuent that ſuperſtition, do not mingle it ſelfe therewithall. And that although otherwiſe the spirit were very free and void from all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: yet herein it is intangled and inwrapped with a certaine kinde thereof, by knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before an image of woode, by hauing his eyes bent thereupon, by framing his ſpeech thereto, by kiſsing the ſame: and in a worde, in holding it vnmeete to pray in any other place, but before an image.</hi> Likewiſe the good Fathers of Trent, proceeding in good earneſt,
<note place="margin">Index expurg. pag. 255.</note> as they are wont in all their matters, haue not forgotten to appoint, that in printing the workes of Eraſmus againe, this place ſhould very diligently be looked vnto and razed out.</p>
               <p>Now if the Church haue beene 500. yeares, &amp; thoſe in her chiefeſt flouriſhing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetting vp or harbouring of any images in her temples, what profite could there be in receiuing of them, or what perill can there now be in taking of them away? what conſcience in perſecuting of ſuch as remoue them? what audacious and impudent boldneſſe in calling ſuch heretickes? when as the firſt fathers called it hereſie to haue any of them, and a diueliſh inuention to bring them in? and what would they haue ſaid of the worſhipping of them?</p>
               <p>But leaſt they ſhould be accompted as dumbe as their images,

How commeth it then to paſſe that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius a writer both more ancient and autentike ſaith rather that he hath read in the records and Monuments of the commonweale of Edeſſa, that Abgarus ſent vnto our Lord to bee healed of him, and ſpeaketh not a word at all of the drawing of his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture?
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15548:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>And what is there in that which is common and equally fitting our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if wee muſt haue images in the Church to worſhip them; and if the Primitiue Church haue had them? For there is nothing to be gathered but the curioſitie of a Prince, ſtrangely affecting a portraiture, and that of a prince which was no Chriſtian; ſo that here can nothing be concluded for Chriſtians. And why do they not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber themſelues, at the leaſt that Pope Gelaſius in his decree, as alſo Iſidore do place this hiſtorie amongſt the Apocrypha, whoſe originall is vnknowne?

And further what a vanitie is it, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by falſe and counterfet images to proue the truth of images? The like is that of the image of the virgine Marie, painted (ſay they) by S. Luke.

Or elſe certainly, ſeeing that it made no greater accompt thereof, being that Church which we follow &amp; ſet before vs for our patterne, let vs ſay, that it was becauſe they then belieued as it now behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to belieue, that there is not due to ſpeake according to the termes of religion, eyther worſhip or reuerence vnto any image whatſoeuer. And if not at thoſe times when images might haue beene kept in ſome true proportion of reſembling them for whom they were made, how much leſſe at this day, when euerie man painteth as his humour and fanſie perſwadeth him? &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Now as wee haue ſeene the diligent endeuoure and induſtrie of the firſt Paſtors of the Church to remoue and put farre away all idolatrie,
<note place="margin">That images were firſt vſed but as monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, in the nature of hiſtories.</note> by the keeping out of Images: ſo conſequently and in the next courſe wee ſhall ſee, how by little and little it was brought in by the careleſſe negligence of their ſucceſſors, and vnder their receiuing and admitting of the ſame, which Sathan deuiſed to be by a gentle

<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta S. Meletri.

This came partly of too much curioſitie; partly of the ſeeking of humaine comfort. In as much alſo as there were celebrated and ſolemnely kept the yearely memorials of the moſt famous Martyrs, as namely the Panegyricks in their praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, &amp; the day of their martyrdome, thereby to kindle the zeale of the Chriſtians, that they might bee the more conſtant in holding out, after their example: It was to be ſeene, that in certaine temples, hiſtories containing ſuch matter were painted, the better to reuiue and keepe aliue, what memorie might let ſlip and fall away: As that of Martyr Barlaam in S.

<note place="margin">Baſilius in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam.</note> ſaying: <hi>Better painted vpon the wall, then deſcribed in his oration and speech:</hi> and that of Theodorus in Gregorius Niſſenus, ſaying: <hi>Where the Maſon hath poliſhed the ſtone, as if it had beene ſiluer, and where the painter hath not spared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of his arte, &amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, the hiſtories of the old and new teſtament vpon the walles of the temple of Nola, which Pontius Paulinus about the yeare 430. cauſed to be painted for to keepe occupied with the conſideration of thoſe tablets, thoſe that came to the feaſt which was made in the honour of S.

But how farre off is all this from worſhipping and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them? There is one onely place alleadged againſt vs vnder the name of Saint Baſill, wherewith they go about to dazell the eyes of the world: <hi>I honour</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the images of the Apostles, and I honour them publiquely, for they haue left vs the ſame by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and therefore it is not to be gainſaid or forbidden, and thereupon alſo we erect and ſet vp in all our Churches, their memorialles and histories.</hi> But vpon their owne conſciences let them ſpeake if euer they haue found any ſuch word in all S.

<note place="margin">Concil. Nic. 2.</note> And in deede this is onely the allegation of Pope Adrian the firſt, writing to the Empreſſe Irene, from the ſecond Councell of Nice 400. yeares after S. Baſill his time, and when as the power and heat of Images did moſt furiouſly rage.</p>
               <p>Now Images were ſcarſe any ſooner receiued into the Churches &amp; Temples,
<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worſhipping of images.</note> then that the people which had lately left and caſt off their paganiſme, thinking to haue found in thoſe of the Apoſtles and Saints, that which they had loſt in their images of their owne Gods, began at their pleaſure to yeeld them the very ſame honor. And this abuſe was ſpread and propagated in diuers places diuerſly, according to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or capacitie, negligence or diligence of the Biſhops: but ſtill ſo as that it gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all mens ſight great and large countries at that time when barbarouſneſſe had ouerrunned the whole Romaine Empire, by the inuaſion of ſuch infinite multitudes of fierce and barbarouſe nations: and that in ſuch ſort, as that being once admitted and receiued, there was not any meanes left to caſt them out againe; the moſt part of the Biſhops thinking they had done ſufficient ſeruice, in letting the worſhipping of them. But how much more prouident were they that had vtterly caſt them out? And how much more wiſely had they dealt if they had taken heed to S. Auguſtine his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition:
<note place="margin">Auguſt. in pſal. 113.</note> 
                  <hi>That they are more mighty to deceiue ſoules, in as much as they haue eyes, then to reforme and amend them, in as much as theſe their eies ſee not at all.</hi>
               </p>

<note place="margin">Gregor. l. 7.

And addeth afterward: <hi>It is one thing to adore a picture, &amp; another to conceiue and apprehend by the picture, that which is to be worſhipped: for the picture is for idiots, &amp; that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for them which can reade.</hi> Hee did not not then acknowledge them for any other thing then remembrances and ſtories: and thereby doubtleſſe in great daunger to haue beene condemned of hereſie, if he had beene at Trent. And in the end, to hold the mid way, he ſaith: <hi>It is needfull and requiſite, that thou ſhouldest call the children of the church, that is, thoſe of thy dioceſſe, and that thou let them ſee &amp; vnderſtand by the teſtimony of the ſcripture, that it is not lawfull to adore or worſhip any of the workes of mens hands: becauſe it is written; Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, &amp; him onely ſhalt thou ſerue. And that thou ſhouldest after this then ſignifie vnto them that thou waſt offended with them, for that they had abuſed themſelues by adoring &amp; worſhipping of ſuch pictures as were not made, but only to teach the histories of ſuch as they did repreſent to ſuch as could not reade: &amp; that that was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherefore thou didſt breake them. And therefore vppon condition that they will containe themſelues within the bonds for which they were admitted and receiued, that thou art content to ſuffer them to enioy them. And to be briefe, if any man will make any, thoſe hinder not: but if they beginne or offer to worſhip any, then looke about thee and ſuffer it not in any caſe.</hi> Now I could haue wiſhed that as Gregory ſaid to him; <hi>Teach them by the ſcriptures, that they muſt not worſhip them: for it is written, &amp;c.</hi> that he alſo had added: yea, but they ought not to haue them for inſtruction: for ſo alſo it is written, &amp;c.

               <p>Now at this time fell in the great ſtrife and contentions which happened about this worſhip and adoration,
<note place="margin">Wars falling out about images.</note> or to ſpeake more properly, the warres of images, or rather of the Empires vnder the colour of images. This ſixt general councell had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the hereſie of the Monothelites, that is, their hereſie who acknowledged but one will in Chriſt, namely, a diuine will. And Conſtantinus Pogonatus had cauſed to be painted in the porch of S. Sophies temple in Conſtantinople, the images of all the fathers which had beene preſent at that councel. But Philippicus holding the foreſaid hereſie, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to bee Emperor, cauſed ſuch images to be taken away. Pope Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine in deſpight cauſed them to be painted in S. Peters porch, &amp; not thoſe onely, which had beene at the ſixt generall councell, but all the fathers which had beene at the 6. general councels. Wherefore now the queſtion of images which had beene but as an acceſſorie, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth chiefe &amp; principall, eſpecially after the Synode held in the time of Conſtantinus Copronymus,
<note place="margin">Bedo. l. 2.

Then Conſtantine the Pope cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a councell at Rome,
<note place="margin">Lib. Pontiſic.

And it is no maruell, ſeeing he alſo was the firſt which would haue his feet kiſſed in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Nicomedia by the Emperor Iuſtinian. And from that time forward, the cruell wars for images betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt, the Greek and the Latine church, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and the Popes, entred and ſet in footing. Philippicus is driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Arthemius, and Arthemius by Theodoſius: who hauing need of the Pope his fauour, for the inſtalling of him, ordained, that images ſhould be reſtored. But this man dying about the end of the yeare, Leo the third, called Iſauricus ſucceeding him, tooke vpon him the hearing of this matter,

He further excommunicated Leo the Emperor; quit of all manner allegiance vnto him all Italie, and forbad his ſubiects to pay him any thing: he confederated himſelf with the French againſt him, couenanting to part the weſterne Empire betwixt himſelf and them. Again, this was one principall cauſe mouing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereto, for that images were nothing but images. Chroniclers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that vpon theſe alterations, there appeared extraordinary eclipſes of the Sunne &amp; Moon, lightnings &amp; thunder, flouds &amp; earthquakes, as warnings of Gods wrath, &amp; of the declining and falling away of the church: but whereat the Popes did no more ſtir then their images.
<note place="margin">Anno 755.</note> After Leo ſucceeded Conſtantinus Copronymus: he aſſembled againe an other councel at Conſtantinople againſt the pretended one of Rome: the Pope was called thereto, but he wold not appeare. Therin it is decreed, <hi>that images ſhal not be honored:</hi> and Gregory Bb. of Naeoceſarea, had the charge of drawing into one book all the reaſons: wherupon the councel grounded this their decree, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himal which were read &amp; ſolemnly publiſhed in the hearing of all the people. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus the Patriark, &amp; Iohan. Damaſcenus the ſon of Manzar, were in expreſſe termes condemned: which treatiſe of Gregory is as yet extant and to be read. Now this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15548:83"/>was no Monothelite, but rather had taken his oath for the eſtabliſhing of the ſixe generall Councels, and whereto he ordained, that this ſhould be added for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, &amp; this he ſignified to the Pope, to the end that he might haue him to cauſe it to be kept &amp; obſerued. Againe, he ſent in like maner to Pipin into Fraunce, who at that time did beare all the ſway there; who cauſed a Councell to be aſſembled at Gentilli: Pipin holding his place by the benefit of the Pope, did therein what fauour he could to his part, &amp; ſo it was concluded therein, that images ſhould be tollerated: it was not as yet ſaid, <hi>that they ſhould be worſhipped.</hi> Yea there were as yet many that reſiſted and ſtood out againſt them, &amp; about this time it was, that they were receiued in England. At this time alſo it was, namely, in the time of Adrian the firſt, that Bbs. began to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their publike actes and writings with the ſigne of the croſſe. In the meane time Stephen the third cauſe it to be decreed in a Councell at Laterane,

               <p>But as Irene the Empreſſe, daughter to a king of the Tartars,

<note place="margin">Concil. Nic. 2 Diacon. l. 23.</note> a great part of the Biſhops there preſent, maintained the aboliſhing of Images: the Empreſſe for diuers coloured conſiderations; went about to exclude them who had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the former: the people were offended, and thereupon ſhe interrupted &amp; brake off the aſſemblie. But the yeare following, after ſhe had diſarmed ſuch as were of the contrary opinion, ſhe baniſhed the beſt and moſt powerfull families maintaining the ſame, and armed thoſe which were the fauourites of images, and ſo called another Councell in the Citie of Nice. There appeared and were to be ſeene Pope Adrian the firſt his letters ful of ſpeciall fauour &amp; good will to her and her Patriarch Tharaſius. There it was alſo in plaine termes (for the deuill was there ſet looſe in all maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious libertie) pronounced, contrary to the opinion of all thoſe which had gone before, yea euen of Gregory the great himſelfe: <hi>That the images of Chriſt, of the virgine Marie, &amp; of all the ſaints muſt be worſhipped &amp; adored.</hi> And there (to be brief) were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all thoſe which ſhould think the contrarie: &amp; the Bbs. who had condemned them in the former Councell, conſtrained to reuoke their ſentence, as namely, Baſill of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra, Theodore of Myra, Gregory of Neocaeſarea; not that old Gregory, but a later: &amp; ſo when they had thus done, they were ſet euery man in his charge &amp; place againe. And it was decreed, that this ſhould be called the ſeuenth generall Councell, and not that of Conſtantinople, held vnder Conſtantinus Copronymus. This Councell was held about the yeare 800. which our aduerſaries are accuſtomed to alleadge for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnder the name of the Nicene Councell, but making ſemblance as though it were the firſt Nicene Councell, &amp; not the ſecond, that ſo they might grace themſelues with the name of that famous councell, which maintaineth the diuinitie and adoring of the Son of God, whereas this, that is the ſecond doth attribute both theſe vnto i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, whereas there is almoſt fiue hundred yeares betwixt the one &amp; the other, the one being held in the time of Conſtantine the great, the deliuerer of the Church, and the other in the time of a mad and brutiſh woman, that was the bloodie butcher to murther her owne ſon, addicted to ſouthſayers, borne of Paganes, and continuing no leſſe by profeſſion, of whom hiſtories make mention, that <hi>the Sun was eclipſed,

               <p>And notwithſtanding at the ſame time, as Adrian the firſt had ſent to Charlemain

And furthermore, for the further gracing of the ſame, publiſhed vnder the name of Charles the Great, which is yet at this day to be read: and was put forth here ſome fortie yeares ſince, by my L. Iean du Tillet, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Meaux. This booke keepeth the meane or middle way betwixt the Synodes of Conſtantinople, and that ſecond of Nice: that is to ſay, <hi>That images might be had to be remembrances of thinges;</hi> which the Councell of Conſtantinople denied: but, <hi>that they might not be worſhipped,</hi> and this the Councell of Nice affirmed. Neither doth it make, as the ſophiſters of our time vſe, by a falſe Grammer, that common diſtinction betwixt an idoll and an image: but it rather affirmeth according to ſound Diuinitie: <hi>We call not idols thoſe images which are in Temples, but we forbid them to bee worſhipped, for feare that they ſhould be called idols, that is to ſay, that by worſhipping of them they become not the thing which they are not.</hi> And to the end that no man may call this booke in queſtion, Auguſtinus Steuchus Biſhop of Agobio, &amp; the keeper of the Popes librarie, teſtifieth that it is kept in the library of Laterane,
<note place="margin">Hinemar. Archiepiſc.

But ſeeing that images had beene retained in Churches, when Charlemaine was once dead, idolatrie found an eaſie reentry in the Weſt, as will be ſeene in the time of Charles his ſonne, who was conſtrained to write a ſharper booke then the firſt: as on the contrarie Conſtantine the ſon of Irene, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his age, would not obſerue &amp; keep that Councell, held in the time of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers regencie, who for that occaſion wrought his death and diſſolution. And this contention in the Empire of Greece, indured more then 200. yeres, according as the Emperours were well or ill inclined, working ſometimes the ruine and ouerthrow of images, and ſometimes, the eſtabliſhing and confirming of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In this contrarietie of Councels,
<note place="margin">A comparing of theſe two councels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> to which of them I pray you, ſhal Chriſtians haue recourſe to ſtay and reſt their conſciences vpon? To whom ſay I, when as they ſee the Eaſt armed againſt the Weſt, about this cauſe and quarrell? yea the Eaſt againſt the Eaſt, that is, the Churches and Empires of thoſe partes at iarre amongſt themſelues? Doubtleſſe nothing can aſſure or certifie them but the word of God: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen image, &amp;c. thou ſhalt not worſhip or ſerue them.</hi> The word which the Popes &amp; Emperors neuer could, neither euer ſhalbe able to diſpatch &amp; quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy from out of the world, neither yet out of the hearts of ſuch as are truely faithful: howbeit, it may be obſerued, that from this time, this commandement beginneth (ſuch is the ſhameles boldnes) to be raced out of the law of God: as may yet be ſeene in the ancient lawes of England,

               <p>But let vs notwithſtanding briefly weigh the reaſons of theſe Councelles, the one againſt the other: becauſe it may be, that out of their diſagreement, wee ſhall make the truth and light to appeare. The Nicene doth alleadge the image which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15548:84"/>Ieſus Chriſt ſent to Abgarus, that which Nicodemus painted vnder the name of a falſe Athanaſius, which we haue proued to bee onely imagined and ſuppoſed: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the viſion of Conſtantine, as it was foretold him by Peter and Paule before that hee was baptiſed, which all eccleſiaſticall hiſtories, together with thoſe next afore mentioned, do note for Apocrypha. It playeth and ſporteth it ſelfe with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as men vſe to doe with Paſquils. Adrian the Pope in his Synodall Epiſtle:
<note place="margin">Concil. Nic. 2, Act. 2,</note> 
                  <hi>God tooke of the myre and clay, and made man according to his owne image and likeneſſe.</hi> And the Prophet Dauid ſaith: <hi>Confeſsion and dignitie are before him.</hi> Againe, <hi>I haue loued the beautie of thy houſe, O Lord, I will ſeeke thy face, &amp;c.</hi> It behooueth therefore (ſaith it) to haue images in Temples. Theodorus ſaith, <hi>As we haue heard, ſo haue we ſeene: wherefore we muſt haue images to looke vpon them.</hi> And <hi>God is wonderful in his Saints:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt haue painted pictures. And, <hi>No man lighteth a candle to put it vnder a buſhell:</hi> therefore it muſt bee ſet vpon Altars. To bee briefe, the Pſalmiſt hath ſaid: <hi>Worſhip his footstoole, worſhip him in his holy mountaine: O Lord, all the riches of thy temple, ſhall worſhip before thy face:</hi> wherefore we muſt worſhip images. But I would verie gladly, that of all the ancient Doctors that haue written vppon the Pſalmes and Prophets, they would ſhew me but one, who hath from theſe places, or any one of them found out images. They alleadge the fathers with like conſcience,
<note place="margin">Queſt. 16.</note> citing an Epiſtle written by Baſill to Iulian, which is not to bee found, and another of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the Great, which is manifeſtly knowne to be written by Gregorie the third: a certaine booke of queſtions vnder the name of Athanaſius in the ſixteenth queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is found to haue beene written by one Leontius, almoſt three hundred yeares after, in the time of the Emperour Mauritius. And how ſhould they ſpare the Doctors, when they haue not beene aſhamed to corrupt the firſt Councell of the Apoſtles held at Antioch; daring to affirme,
<note place="margin">Actes 15.</note> that they therein ordained that the image of our Sauiour Chriſt ſhould bee worſhipped in ſteade of the images of the falſe Gods? Although it be ſo, as that there were not according to their owne confeſſion, any images in the Chriſtian Churches before Conſtantine his time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by charging the Primitiue Church with an vnſupportable crime, for hauing made ſo ſmall accompt of the Apoſtles their ordinance, yea or rather of the holy Ghoſtes, and that in a full Councell. In the end they come to the legends of the Saintes, and to pretended miracles. And what miracles? How that there was a woman healed of the gnawings and gripes that ſhe ſuffered in her bellie, by looking vpon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saint Coſme and Saint Damian: an other of the fluxe, in looking vppon the image of Simeon: and that an other found a Well, by cauſing the image of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius the Abbot to be brought her. An image of the virgine Mary kept the candle of a certaine Abbot from going out a long way: and an other helpeth to conueigh water from the ceſterne to the houſe. And how a woman was tempted of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill by forſaking and leauing to vſe the image of the virgin; whereupon the Abbot Theodorus ſheweth her, that it were better to go to the ſtewes and brothell-houſe a thouſand times, then to leaue and forſake the worſhipping and adoring thereof. What baggage are theſe to oppoſe &amp; ſet againſt the holy law of God, <hi>Giuen</hi> (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by the miniſtery of Angels,</hi> and vttered by his owne mouth: <hi>Thou ſhalt not worship images?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs heare on the contrarie the foundations of the Councell of Francford: <hi>We muſt not</hi> (ſaith it) <hi>worſhip images, ſeeing we muſt not worſhip any beſides one onely God, &amp; one onely Ieſus Chriſt, who with the father &amp; the holy Ghoſt raigneth eternally.</hi> Becauſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>there is neither commandement nor example, either of the Apoſtles, Patriarkes, or prophetes, or of the fathers of the primitiue Church for the ſame. And on the contrary, that if any man haue images for remembrances and monumentes, that yet notwithſtanding it ought not to be any preſident for the trimming &amp; decking vp of the Church: that ſuch ornamentes and courſes are nothing els but the waies of the Gentils: that the good fathers Antonius, Hilarius, and others, who loued well the beautie of the houſe of God, did yet verie well leaue off to haue any dealing with them.</hi> And as little <hi>for the instruction of the people.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15548:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>That God hath giuen them the holy ſcriptures to this end; the law whereby to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, and not by Images.</hi> And not any more <hi>for imitation or example ſake to bee followed: That the vertues of the Saintes, as faith, hope, and charitie, are inuiſible: and that we must therefore ſeeke them in their workes, and not in their painted pictures.</hi> It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proueth, that whatſoeuer the patrons of images alleadge of ſcripture, it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to no end, or contrarie to the end for which they alleadge it; that their tales of the image of Chriſt are Apocrypha, their authorities out of the fathers meerely imaginarie, and their pretended miracles no better then either doubtfull, or noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly falſe, or els diueliſh; <hi>Yea and although</hi> (ſaith it) <hi>that they were true: becauſe that God appeared to Moyſes in a buſh, ſhall we therefore worſhip all buſhes? or vnder the colour of Aarons rod, ſhall we worſhip all rods?

And all theſe things with ſuch grauitie, learning, and religiouſneſſe, together with ſuch reaſons drawne ſo to the purpoſe from the ſcriptures &amp; fathers, S. Ierome, S. Auguſtine, S. Gregorie, &amp;c, and preſſed with ſuch good conſequence and ſo neceſſarily, as that all the Dagons of the Philiſtines, bee they neuer ſo firmely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropped, ſhal not be able poſſiblie to ſtand before them. And yet furthermore this booke is approued by Hincmarus Archbiſhop of Rheimes, who alleadgeth a whole Chapter out of the ſame againſt Hincmarus Biſhop of Laon, who liued in the time of Charles the great: and as for Ecchius himſelfe, hee doeth not once call it in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Let vs go forward with the effectes and ſucceſſe inſuing vppon theſe two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.
<note place="margin">The effect of theſe Councels</note> It appeareth that that of Franckford did ſtay the courſe of idolatrie for a time in the Churches of France and Germanie: which is gathered hereby, namely, for that Haimo and Rabanus, who followed ſhortly after, do not ſpeake a word of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of images: and in that Walfridus Strabo, liuing at the ſame time, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all one phraſe and manner of ſpeech:

                  <hi>That it is not lawfull either to worſhip them, or els to baniſh and cast them out.</hi> And becauſe likewiſe that Claudius a famous Prieſt brought vp in the Court of Charles the Great, was no ſooner made Biſhop of Turin in the time of Lewes the Gentle, then that hee pulled downe and defaced the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: when as hee founde the people of his Dioceſſe giuen to worſhip them, by reaſon of the Romiſh ſuperſtition which had gained and preuailed ſo farre amongſt them.
<note place="margin">Claud. Tauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſ. de ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. imaginum.</note> An Abbot called Theodomirus ſet himſelfe againſt his proceedings: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon this Claudius writte a booke vnto him, againſt the worſhipping of Images, which hee was not afraide to ſend to the Emperour Lewes, who committed the ſame to Ionas of Orleance to examine. But hee neuer vouchſafed to vtter his iudgement of it, till after that both Lewes and Claudius were deade, neither is it found that Claudius was diſturbed or troubled by the French Church vppon this occaſion:
<note place="margin">Anno. 840. Ionas Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. aduerſ. Claud. Tauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſ.</note> a ſigne that the doctrine of images was gouerned by the Councell of Franckford. Now of this booke of Claudius Biſhoppe of Turin, there is no parte to come by, more then that which Ionas his booke (wherein hee goeth about the confutation of the ſame) doeth afford vs, and that after his death. It may
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15548:85"/>iuſtlie bee doubted whether hee haue dealt faithfullie with it in alleadging and ſetting downe the whole: but onely that his owne aunſweres do ſufficiently witnes that Idolatrie as yet was verie young and tender in the Churches of France. Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us reproueth the worſhipping of Images according to the Councell of Francford: Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas doth not maintaine the ſame: for hee aunſwereth onlie as Gregory, aunſwereth Serenus, that they may bee had for inſtruction ſake to the people, and not for to bee worſhipped; proceeding euen to the curſing of them who do worſhippe them. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius maintaineth and proueth by Origen, S. Ierome, Fulgentius, Lactantius, &amp;c. That they ought not to be honored either with inward affection, or worſhipped with outward geſture: That wee ought not either to worſhippe or ſerue any creature, &amp;c. And that it is likewiſe an error to do it for the contemplating of them, whoſe Images they are made to bee. And it is ſo far off, that Ionas ſhould gainſaye this, as that on the contrarie hee ſaith; <hi>As for thoſe that maintaine the worſhipping of Images, and ſaye that they giue not that worſhip vnto the ſimilitude and thing repreſenting, but vnto them which are therein repreſented; as do</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they of the Eaſt Churches, who are ouertaken with this moſt miſchiuous error: wee doe reproue and deteſt them euen as thy ſelfe: And the Lord become both to the one and the other gracious and fauourable, as that they may bee pulled from this vile and deteſtable ſuperſtition.</hi> Claudius affirmed againſt the worſhippers of Images: <hi>The law, Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>forbiddeth vs not onelie the Images of Gods, but all whatſoeuer in generall, that wee ſhoulde worſhippe them.</hi> And Ionas acknowledged that this was a wholeſome, ſound and holie beliefe. Againe, <hi>If the workes of Gods hands be not to be worſhipped</hi> (ſaid Claudius) <hi>much leſse the workes of mens hands.</hi> And Ionas thereto addeth, <hi>Sobrie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcum ſapis, teſtifying that in that point he dealt like a wiſe &amp; prudent teacher.</hi> What is then the oddes betwixt them? Truely this, (ſaith Ionas) namely, that Claudius ought to haue condemned ſuperſtition, and reproued ignorance; and not to haue defaced the Images, and that he ought to haue left them as they were, not to the end that anie worſhip ſhold be done vnto them, but that they might ſerue both for an ornament in the Temple, and for a memoriall of thinges paſt vnto the ignorant. As indeed ſaith hee, <hi>France hath and ſuffereth them; howſoeuer it be held and reputed for a great abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to worſhippe them, and ſo likewiſe the caſe ſtandeth with Germany.</hi> In briefe, that it is a plaine and manifeſt fault, ignorance, error, and ſuperſtition to fall down before the Images of Saintes, but yet that the offenders are to bee reclaimed by reaſon, &amp; not by curſes: in aſmuch as that it can hardlie bee belieued, that they abiding and continuing in the free and holy confeſſion of the bleſſed Trinitie, ſhould haue anie purpoſe or reſolution to turne aſide to the worſhipping of Idols. But how far I pray you was the beliefe of the French and Germaine Churches at that time (that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare 850.) differing from the faith and beliefe of the times that now are? yea and what great oddes is there betwixt the preſent, and that which Ionas held and belieued, notwithſtanding that he was fullie armed and prouided for the defence of Images? And indeed Nicetas teacheth vs, that euen in the time of Fredericke Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beroſſa, about the yeare 1160.
<note place="margin">Nicetas in vita Iſaac.

But the ſtorie following will make vs to ſee the truth much more clearelie: It is therefore to bee known, that in the yeare 824. the Emperours Michaell and Theophilus, the Father and the Sonne being troubled in the Eaſt, about the contention raiſed for Images, the ſame not being poſſiblie able to bee quieted by the ſecond Councell of Nice, doe ſend Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of purpoſe vnto the Emperour Lewes and Lotharius in France, ſetting before them on the one ſide, the ſuperſtitions that were practiſed about Images, ſince the breaking out of this pretended Councell: &amp; on the other ſide, the ſeueritie vſed for

               <p>As concerning the Croſſe, we haue ſeene what the olde Writers haue taught: &amp; againe, it is verie certaine, that thoſe ages were far off from that, which is practiſed at this daye. For the Synode of Francford ſpeaketh of the Croſſe after the maner of S. Paule, and of the purer antiquitie, vnderſtanding by the ſame the whole myſterie of our redemption accompliſhed vpon the Croſſe, as likewiſe the afflictions which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen continuallie amongſt the members of Chriſt. In this ſence S. Paule ſayeth: That he gloryeth in the croſſe, and woulde haue that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be crucified day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie before our eyes, that is, that wee ſhoulde euerie howre remember the ſham full and ignominious death which he hath ſuffered for vs, by dying for our ſinnes,

In the ſame ſence Chryſoſtome ſayeth: <hi>The Croſſ is vnto vs the cauſe of all bleſsednes, the hope of the Chriſtians, the reſurrection of the dead, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer throw of the Diuell.</hi> But of what Croſſe doth hee ſpeake? aſſuredlie of the ſame whereof hee had ſpoken before: <hi>To day he did hang vpon the Croſse;</hi> that is of the death and paſſion of our Lord: <hi>That Croſse</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>which he hath not left here vpon earth, but carried vppe to heauen,</hi> that is, which hee hath ouercome by his reſurrection: which he hath garniſhed and cloathed with all manner of glorie: that Croſſe which wee muſt beare: <hi>Not by laying</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>a peece of wood vpon our ſhoulders, but by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and making our ſelues readie to ſhed our blood at all occaſions for his glorie, &amp;c.</hi> And S. Auguſtine in like manner: <hi>All the ſacraments are perfected by the Croſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> Auguſt.</note> For what are the ſacraments both of the olde and of the new law, but dumbe ſignes without this Croſſe? Likewiſe Honorius Biſhoppe of Autun:

                  <hi>Nowiſe man worſhippeth the Croſſe, but rather Chriſt, that was crucified thereon, &amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding, that he liued in the midſt of groſſe and palpaple darkenes. But what Communion or Fellowſhippe is there betwixt the Croſſe, thus taken and vnderſtood, and theſe two croſſe peeces of wood, wherto Ionas doth applie the former benefits &amp; bleſſings? or with this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pope Adrian? That when we ſee the Croſſe we muſt ſay vnto it: <hi>We worſhip the Croſſe, and we worſhip the Speare, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore the foreſaid Claudius, Biſhoppe of Turin, and brought vp from his childhoode vnder Charles the Great,
<note place="margin">Adrian in Ep. ad Conſtan. &amp; Iren.</note> reaſoned verie well to the purpoſe: and doubtles like vnto himſelfe both for his ſtile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſaying: <hi>If we must worſhip the Croſſe, becauſe that our Lord ſufferd his death and paſſion vpon ſuch a peece of wood, then let vs worſhip all virgins, becauſe hee was borne of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: let vs alſo worſhip the maunger, and ſwathing cloutes, becauſe hee lay therein, becauſe he was wrapped therein: thornes, reedes and speares, for ſuch were inſtruments vſed about him in his paſſion: Aſſes, for Jeſus entred into Ieruſalem ſitting vpon an Aſſe, &amp;c. But ſo the truth is, that our Lord hath commaunded vs to beare, and not to worſhippe the Croſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And I doe not as yet ſee, that Ionas hath deuiſed or found out anie thing to aunſwere him withall.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond Councell of Nice, as it was in all mens ſight ill begunne, ſo it contented not the conſciences of the Grecians in anie reſpect at all. For Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, as he grew out of his minoritie and came to age, and his libertie, did repeale &amp; difanull the ſame. The Emperour Michaell did ſet it vppe again, and perſecuted the gainſayers. The Emperour Leo the fourth an Armenian, encouraged by the Monkes of Greece, which cried out, that to worſhippe Images was idolatrie, did pull them downe againe. Michael le Begue and Theophilus his ſonne,
<note place="margin">Zona. tom. 3.</note> did chaſtiſe and correct ſuch as did maintaine them. Theodore his wife, came by his death to the Regencie, and being perſwaded by other Monkes, did reeſtabliſh them with great ſeueritie. Her ſonne Michael Bardus being come to full age, did deſtroy and ouerturne them againe. Likewiſe Zonara the great patron and maintainer of Images, doth tell vs, that he made the Pope his Legate to conſent and agree thereunto. Inſomuch as that pope Adrian obtained of Baſill the ſucceſſor of this Bardus, that there ſhoulde a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15548:87"/>Councell bee helde at Conſtantinople,
<note place="margin">Anno 870.</note> which they call ordinarilie the eight generall Councell, whoſe Actes and decrees wee cannot finde extant in the volumes of the Councels, and but a verie fewe of them elſe where in hiſtories. And Bartholomeus Caranza ſayeth that hee met with them ſo depraued and falſified, as that he durſt not coppie them out. Onelie the Popes fauourites doe affirme, that therein ſhould bee confirmed the worſhipping of Images: and the curſes of the ſecond Councell of Nice repeated. So that wee neede not doubt, if we conſider the proceeding, ſuch as it is ſet downe in the Pontificall booke it ſelfe,
<note place="margin">Lib. Pontifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</note> that is to ſay, that Adrian the Pope gaue vnto his Legates a little booke containing all that hee would haue to be belieued of the ſupremacie of the Pope, and of the worſhipping of Images, with this charge, that they ſhould not receiue or admit any man into counſel or conſultation with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had firſt ſigned the ſame: but that by this meanes hee preuailed in the cauſe hauing no aduerſe partie to ſtand againſt the ſame. Againe, that which is left remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with vs, is ſuch ſtuffe, as that it would make a man quake and tremble to reade it; the Emperour Baſill vttering theſe ſpeeches therein; <hi>Now are you out of the Diuelles clouches, true Chriſtians, worthy of eternall life: for if you had not abandoned this hereſie, Chriſt could haue profited you nothing.</hi> How manie hereſies, yea and how many blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be there in theſe few wordes? <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>doth profite vs nothing if we bring in againe the ceremonies of the law.</hi> But what manner of concluſion is this: If we obſerue and keepe this Commaundement being one of the ten: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make any grauen Image: Thou ſhalt not worſhippe them, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt doth profite vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. An other Canon ſayth: <hi>We ordaine that Images be worſhipped as the holie Goſpell.</hi> The reaſon hereof is worth the noting: for ſay they, <hi>As men are ſaued by the ſillables of theſe bookes: euen ſo are both the wiſe and fooliſh mightily helped by Images.</hi> And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe their beetle headed reaſons; Nicaetas and Zonara, do write, that from that time forwarde, all ſuch were accounted Heretikes, as did not adore and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe Images. And yet ſo as that this kinde of ſuperſtition, did neuer proceede or proſper in the Churches of Greece, as it did amongſt the Latines; for beſides the Greeke Churches had but a few and thoſe painted pictures onelie, and not any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or carued Images, the difference betwixt them in the maner of worſhipping them is ſo great, that Emericus in the volume of his inquiſitions, rehearſing the errors of the Greekes, ſetteth down theſe; That they may not pray vnto Saintes, no not vnto the holy virgin Marie; That they hold, that to offer vnto them, is to offer ſacrifice vnto the Diuell; as alſo that to worſhip or kiſſe the Croſſe, is meere impietie, &amp; ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſottiſhnes. But this muſt be diſtinguiſhed of, according to the times and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>But from hence forward, let vs lanch forth into the depth of Idolatrie. We make our ſelues offenſiue to the Iewes in giuing them matter to ſtumble at, and as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as any ſtench vnto the Turks, whome it had beene our duties rather to haue wonne and drawne to haue beene one with vs by the puritie of doctrine, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of our ceremonies. The more contradiction we find, the more care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie doe wee bring with vs for the propagating and ſpreading abroad of the ſame, the more authoritie for to eſtabliſh it, and the greater rage and furie for to warrant and make good the ſame withall. The Princes working the ſame ſometimes in deſpight, ſometimes vpon enuie and malice, which they beare one againſt an other, but all of them to gratifie and pleaſure the Biſhoppe of Rome: The Pope by his Decrees, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and curſes, by degrading and putting down of Emperours, by abſoluing their ſubiects of their oaths, &amp; by rooting out and burning of all whoſoeuer ſhall dare to ſay any thing to the contrarie, &amp;c. In fine the pure ſeruice of God, maintained ſo long a time vnder the Primitiue Church, becommeth hereſie, and from hence forwarde, no man ſpeaketh of them, which will not worſhip Images by any other name or tr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle then heretikes: the worſhipping of them on the contrarie, is accounted for ſound and good to bee belieued, yea and is reckoned vp amongſt the markes and principal ſignes of the Church. In the meane time to bring about the worſhipping of Images

                     </gap>fling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.</note> the Church of Rome was forced from the beginning to bring into them ſome certaine diſtinctions and limitations, carrying ſome more plauſible conſtruction and conſideration as that of <hi>Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> from the thing repreſenting, to the thing repreſented: howbeit they are not of anie force or worth either in Grammer or Diuinitie; but onelie as certaine vizardes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the time of ſhamefaſt baſhfulnes, to couer the follie of the ſecond Councel of Nice.

And thus the beſt learned in the Greeke do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete and take it, what reaſon is there then, that the leſſe part ſhould bee giuen to God, and the greater vnto men? And who can thinke that S. Auguſtine who firſt brought vp this dinſtinction, did vnderſtand it after that manner; who ſhutteth the deceaſed Saints &amp; Martyrs out of al Temples, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing any Altars, ſacrifices or ſeruices done vnto them? And that yet our aduerſaries, ſhould giue them the ſame vnder the colour of this word <hi>Dulia?</hi> And in verie deede S. Auguſtine hath no ſuch intent or ſcope in that place, namelie, to giue vs free libertie to ſerue creatures, but rather to detaine and draw vs backe from the ſame, ſhewing vs what is the true ſeruice of God, that ſo we may not giue it vnto anie creature. For he that reproued Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina becauſe ſhe burned incenſe to the Image of Chriſt, what would hee haue ſaide to them which burne incenſe euerie day vnto the Images of the Saintes? And hereupon alſo it came that the Spaniard Pereſius found fault with this diſtinction. And as for the other, namelie, <hi>That they doe not worſhip the Image, but the thing whereof it is a ſigne:</hi> can they deny that the Pagans ſaid not aſmuch vnto S. Auguſtine, Lactantius, Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius and Tertullian, who yet did not therefore ſurceaſe or giue ouer to reproue and condemne them? And if they coulde not tell how to excuſe the matter or defende themſelues againſt thoſe Fathers;
<note place="margin">Idem l. 3. de doctr. Chriſti. c. 7.8. &amp; 9.</note> what hope is there left that our Idolaters can ſpeed any better in the ſame cauſe and matter? But S. Auguſtine cutteth off al excuſe by a generall propoſition, ſaying: <hi>The ſignes of the Iewes are profitable, becauſe they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God: but thoſe of the Gentiles vnprofitable, as their Images, pictures, &amp;c. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that in them they bee properlie giuen to honour their Gods.</hi> Afterwarde hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the one and the other, ſaith; <hi>If thou honour the ſignes, in ſtead of the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, intending the honour vnto theſe, and not to them: yet this is notwithſtanding a carnal ſcrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, wheras Christian libertie hath euen deliuered the Iewes.</hi> And ſo by this meanes this reſpectiue kinde of worſhip goeth downe the ſtreame,

As if God had bound himſelf by the commandements that he hath giuen vs, and left vs free: As if Abraham had aunſwered God, I will not ſacrifice my Son: for thou haſt ſaid; <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> But wee haue authority to beare vs out for the caruing and worſhipping of Images; let them ſhew vs a contrary commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, forbidding vs to make any. To this blaſphemous obiection, by which they make God the author of their abhomination, they ſhal be aunſwered by Tertullian for me; Tertullian being beaten with this argument by the Idolaters of his time:
<note place="margin">Tertul. de Idolo.</note> (for euen as they haue borrowed their Idols, ſo haue they alſo their arguments for their defence,) ſaith; <hi>It agreeth verie well, that the ſame God who hath forbidden in his law to make any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or likenes, hath likewiſe commaunded by an extraordinarie commaundement for to make that of the Serpent: If thou worſhippe and feare this ſame God, thou haſt his law for thy direction therein: Make not anie ſimilitude or likenes, and if thou conſider the commaundement that commeth after, inioyning one to bee made, in that thou art to imitate and do as Moſes did: Make no image or likenes contrarie to the law, if this ſame God do not expreſly commaund it.</hi> And by this meanes Tertullian cutteth them off quite, inferring that the law of God is generall, and that no man muſt dare or preſume to doe any thing to the contrarie, without an expreſſe exception, and the ſame to iſſue and come forth of the ſame mouth: which thing Paulus Ricius though one of their ſide doth reſolue them of in this manner, ſaying: <hi>The law of the Lord forbiddeth thee to kindle any fire for thy familie vpon the Lordes day, and thou ſinneſt mortallie if thou do it, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee commaunded thee to kindle a fire in the verie ſame day in the Tabernacle. The like is that of the Cherubins, ordained by the expreſſe word of God, howbeit to haue Images is fetcht from ſome other fountaine, then his commaundement, being ſuch an abhomination and miſchief as cannot bee anſwered.</hi> Wherefore our aduerſaries deale herein, as our firſt Father did, being taught therunto by the Diuell: for when God went about to tel him of his ſin, he would poſt it ouer to another, ſaying: <hi>The woman which thou gaueſt me was the cauſe:</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:15548:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſo they became the wofull accuſers of the moſt vpright God. If wee bee Idolaters it is thy worke: for wherefore didſt thou euer cauſe that the ſimilitude of Cherubins or Serpents ſhould be ſet vp, &amp;c? But their condemnation waiting for them is iuſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing drawne it vpon themſelues, in aſmuch as they will pretend vnto themſelues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and priuiledge to lift and aduance themſelues aboue all that is of God, yea euen aboue his plaine and expreſſe lawes. And that ſuch a priuiledge, as may ſeeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him alone, and that in this very reſpect, being denied vnto all others: For the Greeke churches notwithſtanding, the curſes and excommunications of the ſeconde Councell of Nice, did cleaue vnto their pictures: but honouring them rather after a ciuill then a religious ſort. The Abiſſines and Armenians in like manner, howbeit there are alſo ſome, as Aluarez reporteth vnto vs, which haue not any at all, and thoſe which haue, to ſhew that they bee the goodlie preſents of the Bb. of Rome, doe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that it is good, that they ſhould haue no other but Latine inſcriptions: ſo now this ſame which wold be but the fountain &amp; original, is become the ſtream to ouerflow the ſeruice of God, and as a mightie floud, to couer and drowne vp the whole earth.</p>

And this was after the year 700. Inſomuch as that it may ſeem, that this cuſtom entred into the Latine Church about the ſame time that the popes delighted themſelues to trim vp their churches, with al maner of Iewiſh ceremonies, after they had once ſpoild and robd it of al her principal and goodly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments indeed, as humilitie, ſimplicitie, purity, &amp;c.

               <p>The like hath beene about the wine of the Lordes Supper. Some vnder the colour of ſobrietie, would vſe water and not wine. Of ſuch S. Auguſtine and Epiphanius make mention amongſt the Heretikes, and not without cauſe, ſeeing they aboliſhed one part of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament. But S. Cyprian doth refute them ſharpelie: and bringeth them backe to the inſtitution of Chriſt, who onely muſt bee heard in all thinges concerning them. And hereupon it is, that he hath it ſo oft in his writings: <hi>That in this ſacrament which is Chriſt, no man is to be heard but Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> Others would haue the wine delaied with water: and the moſt auncient Chriſtians did ſo vſe it, and that not without apparant ſhew: inaſmuch as the people of the Eaſte, did not ordinarilie vſe wine without water, as the Hebrew and Greeke phraſes of ſpeech do proue: howſoeuer they alledge other reaſons for thus their vſing of it: as, that there came out of our Lord his ſide water and blood: That this is a ſigne of the two natures in Chriſt, or rather of the vnion of Chriſt with his church, allegorizing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon euerie thing according to their accuſtomed maner. Howſoeuer it bee notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it may bee that the courſe of the text, would not ſhew vs in this particular point of the blood and water, anie thing but the true and vndoubted death of the Lord: in this that the wound had pierced the caſe of his heart: becauſe alſo, that if wee ſhould fall to allegorizing, then with the greateſt part of the Fathers, we ſhold thence collect and gather the two ſacraments of the Church, that is, Baptiſme from the water, and the Euchariſt from the blood, &amp;c. Onely let vs not finde fault with this obſeruation, prouided that it bee voide of ſuperſtition, that is, free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of thoſe, which do not adminiſter anie thing but onely wine, as alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preiudice to the libertie which Chriſt hath left vnto his children, which will not admit any manner of neceſſitie, but that which is grounded vpon the holy word. If any doe contrarywiſe bring in any other neceſſitie, wee affirme that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an error, becauſe as they themſelues do ſay, to make that to bee a matter of faith, which is not, is to ſinne and erre in the faith: And therefore wee condemne the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the church of Rome, which ſay abſolutelie, that the wine cannot bee admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred without water,

It is certaine that the Churches of Armenia vnto the time of the Councell of Ferrara, which was vnder Eugenius the fourth, did not vſe any thing but onelie pure wine, and yet were neuer excommunicated therefore: and as yet to this day, they doe not obey vnto that which they were made ſubſcribe vnto in the Councell. And the Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſtand ſo ſtrictlie vpon the point, as that they wold neuer conſent, that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Prince ſhould bee married to any that receiued the Communion without the wine. And as for the Grecians, Durandus, Scotus and Innocentius doe ſaye that in their time for the moſt part they did the like: howbeit that in the Lithurgies, which we can come by,

And as for the Churches of the Latines, the Councel of Orleance forbiddeth to offer wine delaied with water, adding the reaſon thereto: <hi>Becauſe it is ſacriledge to offer anie other

The Councell of Wormes more then 200. yeares after ordained the contrarie: after which followed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Tiuoli or Tibur, a Citie of the Sabines, wherein it was ordained, that there ſhould be one third part of water put to two third partes of wine. And theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may at the leaſt ſuffice to ſhew the indifferentneſſe. But the Gloſſe of the decree ſaith, that this is <hi>De honeſtate tantum, onely in regard of honestie.</hi> And Thomas: <hi>that this is not fetcht or deriued from the Gospell, but that it hath ſome apparant ſhew for it ſelfe, as that by reaſon of the ſtrength of the wine, it is delaied in ſome countries.</hi> And Hales, Scotus, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauentura ſay, <hi>It hath no hold or warrant in the ſcriptures.</hi> And Richardus: <hi>Non de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitate, ſed de congruitate: not for any neceſsitie, but for ſeemelines.</hi> And thereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the councell of Trent doth excommunicate and cut off from ſaluation, as farre as lyeth in it, for fantaſies and things nothing making vnto ſaluation.

               <p>Now the bread prouided and prepared for the holy Supper, was carried either in a linnen cloth, or in a ſmall cheſt, as we reade in S. Ierome, and ſet vpon the holy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, couered with ſome table napkin, for to keep it cleane, without any other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Men and women did touch it without any ſuperſtitious ſcrupulouſnes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they brought their offeringes, yea and after the bleſsing or conſecrating of it. It was diſtributed vnto the faithfull, not into their mouthes, as we haue ſeene it, but into their owne hands. And as for the wine, it was carried, as we reade in the ſame S. Ierome, in veſſels of all ſorts, euen of glaſſe, notwithſtanding the daunger of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them: yea and ſometimes it was ſent in that ſort, in ſigne of vnitie and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from one to another. Vaine &amp; curious ſuperſtition came in afterward, firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding women, and then afterward men alſo, to touch either the linnen clothes,

Tranſubſtantiation was ſet at a higher price and rate then all the reſt, for in reſpect therof the cups muſt be halowed, as alſo the patines of the ſame, with vnctions and wordes expreſly vttered, becauſe of it, all the inſtruments and veſſels of this ſacrament, were turned into Sacraments, the Altar ſtone was called the ſepulcher or graue, and the linnens, the ſhroude wherein the bodie of our Lord was inwrapped: that from thenceforth the cuppes ſhould be of mettal, &amp; that ſiluer, not any longer of glaſſe. Things which antiquity (more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſigns) did neuer ſo much as once dreame of: becauſe that ſhe could neuer once bethinke her ſelf, or conceiue any thing of this monſtrous doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, the fountaine and welſpring of ſo many and ſo fooliſh vanities. And in deed whereas the Primitiue and ancient church had care according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of S. Paul, that the faithfull the proper veſſels of the body and bloud of our Lord, ſhold receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthily: we ſee the councels after theſe times to conuert and turne all this zeale, &amp; all this care, from the ſpirit to the fleſh, from ſpirituall temples, to materiall ones: from the veſſels of God, elect vnto ſaluation, to the implements &amp; inſtruments onely which they vſed in the adminiſtration hereof.

Let the clothes wherein it is wrapped be a verie faire and cleane linnen cloth. After the Maſſe let them be put into a booke of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and before they be deliuered to be ſcoured and waſhed cleane with lee, let them be waſhed in the Church by the Prieſt, Deacon or Subdeacon: becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they be spotted &amp; ſtained with the blood of our Lord.</hi>

But and if there do any thing of the body or of the blood fall vpon the couering or pall of the Altar, let them in any caſe cut it away and burne it, and lay the aſhes in ſome cleane place, &amp;c:</hi> a great matter, if ſo be ſuch regard &amp; care were ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the ancient church ſhould forget this; or that the ancient church whereof we ſtand ſo greatly, hauing neglected it, we ſhould notwithſtanding hold it ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and neceſſarie.</p>

But all this great adoe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration came in a long time after, the Church through the corruption of the time proceeding by little and little from the inward to the outward, from the center to the circumference; from the ſubſtance to the circumſtance; and from the diſcipline of Chriſt, to an imperiall ſtatelineſſe and eminencie in the world.</p>
               <p>Now theſe ſacraments being there placed, wee haue declared the manner of the bleſsing, conſecrating and diſtributing of them to the faithfull, with what prayers &amp; with what holy wordes, &amp;c.

He likewiſe that ſo expreſly commandeth fathers to teach their children the cauſe of the inſtitution of his ſacraments, (namely, that of the Paſſeouer, into whoſe roome that of ours, called the holy Supper is come:) who would that children ſhould queſtion their fathers therof, &amp; that fathers ſhould anſwer their children, &amp; that in the time of the ſhadows of the old Teſtament, &amp; rudiments of the law, ſhal not be vnderſtood and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15548:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>taken to haue meant, that his people ſhould be taught in a language not vnderſtood, neither yet to haue taken it for an honour and worſhip to bee praied vnto and ſerued of them, without vnderſtanding. And in deede the Sacramentes of the old lawe are inſtituted in the Hebrew tonge, which was the vulgar and common language a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people. And againe, when he would terrifie and make them afraid, hee threatneth them with a ſtrange and barbarous language,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. c. 14</note> and with lips which they do not vnderſtand. And S. Paule concludeth, ſaying: <hi>Tongues are ſignes not to the beleeuers, but to the infidels and vnbeleeuers.</hi> And there is no cauſe why it ſhould be here alleadged, that from the time of Eſdras vnto Chriſt the people had learned the Chaldee tongue vnder the captiuitie, and that yet notwithſtanding the Scriptures were alwaies read in the Church in the Hebrew tongue. For the queſtion is not in what tongue it was read: but whether it were vnderſtood of the people or not.
<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.2.</note> And for that let Eſdras himſelfe be belieued, ſaying: <hi>Eſdras the Prieſt brought the law before a multitude of men and women, and all thoſe which could vnderſtand.</hi> So then it may bee ſeene hereby, that not ſo much as the women but they vnderſtood it. <hi>He read the ſame vnto them in the ſtreet before the water gate, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breake of the day vntill noone: and the eares of all the people were attentiue to the booke of the law.</hi> Wherefore were they thus attentiue, but that they had a purpoſe and intent to vnderſtand?

<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.8.3</note> 
                  <hi>They themſelues did reade diſtinctly &amp; plainly for to vnderſtand, &amp; did vnderstand it in reading of the ſame.</hi> What is that other properly, but to reade Eſdras, without hauing any purpoſe to vnderſtand him? But ſay they, It is ſaid, that Eſdras and the Leuites did expound the law vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. True, but it is as plaine and cleare,
<note place="margin">Nebe. 8. v. 7.9.</note> that it was the ſence and meaning of the law and not the words or phraſes of ſpeech, for this ſelfe ſame Chapter hath alreadie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and aſſured vs that they vnderſtood them. And in the ſame ſence it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Act. 8.35.</note> that our Lord and Sauiour expounded Eſay in the Sinagogue, whereat the people were rauiſhed: and the ſcriptures likewiſe vnto his diſciples in Emaus:
<note place="margin">Suk. 24.27.</note> that Philip expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the 53. of Eſay to the Eunuch. Who will belieue that this great noble man did not vnderſtand the words, ſeeing he did reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? ſeeing alſo he demanded whether the Prophet did ſpeak of himſelf or of ſome other? But in deed he did not know that this propheſie was of Chriſt. For whereas they go about to make vs belieue, that the Iewes did not vnderſtand Hebrew, vnder the colour of certain words, which their familiaritie with the Chaldeans had dropped into their language,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39. Act. 17, 11.</note> the truth may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare: for wherefore then ſhould our Sauiour haue ſaid vnto the people: <hi>Search the ſcriptures?</hi> And how ſhould the Iewes of Berea haue otherwiſe done as they did. And what will they ſay to that in the Actes, that S.
<note place="margin">Act. 21.40.22.2.21.</note> Paule made an oration vnto the people in the Hebrew tong, &amp; that the people hearing him ſpeake vnto them in that language made the more ſilence? And if they did not vnderſtand, whence commeth it, that when he ſpake of going to the Gentiles, the people ſhould be in a mutinie, &amp; crie out: <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow, let him be taken from off the earth; it is not meete that he ſhould liue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore we ſtand reſolued and firme:
<note place="margin">That it was not otherwiſe vnder the new Teſtament.</note> that in the time of the old teſtament the ſeruice of God was practiſed and exerciſed in a language vnderſtood of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and who can belieue that it was otherwiſe in the time of the newe? who will belieue that the light ſhould be more darke then the ſhadow? &amp; the fulneſſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more barbarous and rude then the rudiments? without all peraduenture our Lord is come to diſmaske the myſtery concealed &amp; kept cloſe from before all worlds, to vnfold them, and lay them broade open to the Iewes, to the Gentiles, to all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and to all languages.

But to the end they may not attribute that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the worthines of the tongue, or to the prerogatiue which they pretend to be purchaſed by the title of the croſſe; in ſuch place as where their language is not greek, and yet their Church ordered after the manner of the Greeke churches, their ſeruice is in the vulgar language of their countrie, and not in Greeke. This is euident by all the Churches that are in that great Empire of Muſcouia and Ruſsia, in all which
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15548:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>there is no other language receiued or heard then the common and vulgar: howſoeuer they acknowledge and approue of the courſe of the Patriarch of Conſtantinople and the Greeke confeſsion.</p>

                     </gap>ine chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> let vs not imagine that there was any other rule kept and obſerued in them. The Greek tong, ſaith Cicero, went in his time almoſt ouer all the world: the Latine, alſo becauſe of the Empire had ſpred verie farre. And this is it which maketh ſome ſhew and likelihood, that the ſeruice of diuers of the Weſterne regions was ſaid in Latine: but yet ſo notwithſtanding as that euen there alſo the rule will proue generall, namely: that were it in Latine, or were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: yet in the old and ancient Weſterne Churches it was alwaies ſo as it was in others, namely, in a language vnderſtood of the hearers. The vulgar and natural ſpeech in Italy was Latine, and therefore wee are of iudgement, that in the neighbour prouinces of Spaine, Fraunce, &amp;c. there is likelihoode, that the Empire in eſtabliſhing his lawes, did likewiſe propagate and multiplie the vſe of his language: as in deed the prouinces were reported to ſpeake Romaine, that is the tongue of the Empire; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that their originall language was neuer altogether aboliſhed and extinct. But if it bee doubtfull whether the ſeruice there were done in Latine or no, yet it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth certaine and firme, that it was done in a language knowne and vnderſtoode of the people. Sulpicius in the life of Saint Martine, ſaith; <hi>As the Reader,
<note place="margin">Sulpicius in vita Martin.</note> whoſe courſe it was to reade vppon that day, was detained by the throng of people, one of his aſsistants taking the Pſalter, betooke himſelfe to the firſt verſe that bee met withall. Now the Pſalme was, Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklinges thou haſt perfected thy praiſe, &amp;c. Which place being read, there was a ſhout and crie made by the people, in ſuch ſort, as that all their aduerſaries were aſhamed and confounded.</hi> The people no doubt was moued with that which they vnderſtood: yea it is moſt cleare and manifeſt, that it was ſo: for if this portion of ſcripture were read at this day in the midſt of our common people of Fraunce: it is moſt certaine, that ſeeing the ignorance that raigneth amongſt them, there is not one that woulde be moued to crie, in as much as not any one woulde take any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereto. And as for Spaine, it appeareth that the Latine tongue hath beene fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in it of old, by the ſteppes and markes thereof remaining amongſt them ſtill, by the lawes which the Gothes eſtabliſhed amongſt them, by the Gothiſh Code (as they call it) which is written in very good Latine,
<note place="margin">Lucius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculus. l. 5.</note> and by thoſe worthy perſonages which haue ſprung out from amongſt them, as lightes of the Latine tongue, as Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane and the Senecas, with diuers others. In ſo much as one of their Chroniclers ſaith, that if the Gothes and the Mores had not come into Spaine, the Spaniſh tongue had remained as pure and incorrupt, as the Romaines their language was in the time of Cicero: and therefore if their ſeruice were in Latine, it was vulgar: if it were not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, then had Iſidore, Archbiſhop of Seuill, ſaid in vaine:
<note place="margin">Iſidor. de eccle. Offi. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That when there is ſinging in the church, it behoueth euery man to ſing, and when there is praying, that euerie man doe pray:</hi> for what edge or quickning to the ſpirit can the ſinging of a Pſalme, or the making of a praier that is not vnderſtood affoord &amp; bring? And ſo of England; the language of their Iland was peculiar to themſelues, and no Latine amongſt them, ſaue what the Romain Colonies did ſpeake. They will haue it, that Chriſtian religion was eſtabliſhed there in the time of Ioſeph of Aremathia: howbeit Chryſoſtome ſaith, that it was about his time. And yet neuertheleſſe S. Gregory ſaith, that in his time, the tong of the ancient inhabitants of great Britaine, called at this day England,
<note place="margin">Gregor. in Iob. c. 27.</note> had no better a ſound then a <hi>barbarum frendere, a rude and barbarous kind of grunting:</hi> and how then could the Latine ſeruice be found there? But the truth is, (as certaine Engliſh Ieſuits do confeſſe) that S. Auguſtine the Monke ſent by Gregorie, did there chaunge and alter both the forme and tongue wherein they had before celebrated their ſeruice: for they could not fetch or deriue the antiquitie of their religion any further off. They ſay, it cannot at the leaſt be denyed, but that the Latine ſeruice was vſed in the Churches of Africke: then let vs adde thereto, that the Latine tongue was alſo common there amongſt the raſcall and poorer ſorte of people. This appeareth, for the ſermons of Saint Cyprian
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15548:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>and S. Auguſtine Bbs. of Africke, were made in the Latine tongue. Now wee are of the ſame iudgement with our aduerſaries: that ſermons euer were, &amp; ſo ought to be made for the inſtruction of the people in the common &amp; vulgar tong: becauſe (ſay they) that properly they are to be applyed and fitted for the capacitie of the people, &amp; praiers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vnto God. But in another place. S. Auguſtine ſaith, that being borne in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Taguſta in Africa,
<note place="margin">Idem. l. 1. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. c. 10.</note> he had learned the Latine tong, <hi>Inter blandimenta nutricum, by means of the sporting &amp; pleaſing speeches which are currant amongst cockering nurſes:</hi> that is, in his ſwathing clothes, or whiles he was very young &amp; tender: whereby it appeareth that nurſes had the knowledge of it. Againe he ſaith: <hi>To the end, that euen the moſt ſimple and ignorant may ſee &amp; perceiue, that it is of purpoſe becauſe of the Donatiſts, I haue turned a pſalme into Latine, that it may the better remaine with them &amp; be remembred.</hi> Hence is proued, that it was common to the baſeſt and courſeſt kind of people. And for as much as that the people there did not ſpeake good congruitie, S. Auguſtine applyeth himſelf vnto their Solaeciſmes,
<note place="margin">Idem in pſal. 118.</note> ſaying; <hi>oſsum</hi> for <hi>os:</hi> and ſometimes taking one caſe for another, ſaying: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is far better that the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marians ſhould reproue vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the people ſhould not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand vs.</hi> In a word, he ſaith, <hi>This is a Prouerbe amongst the Carthaginers: I wil tel it you in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in aſmuch as you al do not vnderſtand &amp; conceiue the Punicktong.</hi> Hence it followeth that the Latine tong was better knowne in Afrike, then the Punicke it ſelfe. But will you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee, that whereas the knowledge of this tongue was wanting in this country, there they did not tie themſelues to haue their ſeruice in it? Throughout all Sclauonia, they had their ſeruice in the Dalmatian tong,
<note place="margin">Ecchius de Miſſa Latina.</note> &amp; S. Ierome likewiſe did tranſlate it into their tong: and our aduerſaries are of iudgement, that it is ſtill ſo obſerued there vnto this day. In this part of Italie likewiſe called great Greece, ouer againſt Sicilia, it is ſaid in Greeke, becauſe the Greeke tong was there vulgar and common.

<note place="margin">Walaſr. c. 7.</note> it was obſerued after the like maner &amp; order: in ſo much as that Walafridus the Abbot ſaith, that euen in his time the Northern countries had their ſeruice in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine tong.
<note place="margin">Aeneas Sylu. hiſtor.

Now this old cuſtome of the Church is to be compared &amp; ioyned with thoſe goodly Maxims &amp; generall rules of the ancient Doctors. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſaith:

<note place="margin">Innocent. 3. Extrauag. de offi. iud. ordin.</note> if we conclude &amp; ſhut it vp with a ſentence againſt the Pope, &amp; that vttered by a Pope?

                  <note place="margin">Concil. Latera. c. 9.</note> And the ſame is ordained in the Councell of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane, Chap. 9. Our aduerſaries ſay, that the ſame extendeth no further then to the two languages of Greeke &amp; Latine: which thing we deſire to be proued. Yea rather let vs ſay and boldly affirme to the contrarie, that this was decreed vpon the requeſts of diuers nations that had taken Conſtantinople: as namely, Germans, Frenchmen, Italians, Engliſhmen, &amp;c. whereunto they reply and anſwere, how that at leaſt it was neuer yet kept or obſerued. And I can tell them, that Leo the tenth did permit vnto the Chaldeans and Syrians their ſeruice in their vulgar tongue, &amp; that at Rome. But for a ſecond anſwer, who knoweth not that the beſt Canons are neglected euen in the Church of Rome? And further therewithall take this, how that this decree was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare 1200.</p>
               <p>It is then the next queſtion to know how ſo great a change and alteration ſhould happen? In which point let vs note, that it is but in the Latine Church:
<note place="margin">A tongue not vnderſtood in the Romane Church onely, and by what meanes.</note> for in all other places ſeruice is vnderſtood of the people: a prerogatiue purchaſed &amp; obtained part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ignorance, &amp; partly of malice, which is fallen vpon them more then vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But yet further, how and by what meanes in the Latine Church? certainly in part by the alteration and changing of tongs, and in part by changing of ſeruices, for that Pope Gregory did vndertake the change &amp; alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in the Latine church, which the Popes his ſucceſſors cauſed to be receiued, as we haue alreadie ſaid by the authoritie of princes, &amp; aboue all the reſt by the worke of Pipin &amp; Charlemaine: the Popes and they, the one of them lending their hand to the other, the one by the authoritie of the ſpirituall Monarchie, and the other by the authoritie of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. And to the end, that all might depend and relie vppon Rome: they cauſed their ſeruice to bee receiued in all the Weſterne prouinces, and that not onely after
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15548:96"/>the Romaine order, but alſo in the Romaine tongue. The abettors and furtherers whereof were Remigius Archb. of Roan, brother to Pipin: amongſt the French men, Boniface an Engliſh man, Archbiſhop of Mentz in Germanie, and Auguſtine the Monke an Italian Archbiſhop of Canterburie in England. And afterward, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the infidels were ſudbued by the Chriſtian Princes, the Latine ſeruice was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after the maner of the Romiſh Church, as in Sueueland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, Saxonie, Bauaria, &amp;c: The tongues alſo, in as much as the Northerne nations did ouerflow the whole Weſterne Empire for a long time, did likewiſe there take roote, and ſettle their abode: whereupon inſued ſo great and groſſe a corrupting of tongues, and eſpecially of the Romiſh, which was for the moſt part admitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in thoſe places, in ſo much as that by little and little it came to paſſe, that the common people did not any more vnderſtand it: ſo farre differing from it ſelfe, in proceſſe of time became the tongue which had beene ordinarie and common, that is to ſay the Romaine tongue, from that which ſometime it had beene, when they did vſe both to ſpeake and write in it. Which thing is eaſily found out and perceiued to haue happened in Italie, Spaine, and Fraunce, where the tongues vſed at this day were but dialects or manners of ſpeech ſomewhat differing at the firſt: and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards all of them,
<note place="margin">Or the Latine tong ſomwhat corupted.</note> corruptions of the Latine tongue. The ſeruice therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill in Latine, and the vulgar language altering and chaunging: the ſeruice, which at the firſt was eaſie to be vnderſtood of the people, became rude and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vnto them, that is, ſuch as they vnderſtood not, the prelates hauing no care to draw them backe againe to the firſt inſtitution, whether lulled aſleepe through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſecuritie, or willingly admitting the meanes whereby they might excell and go beyond the laitie, &amp; therewithall the well inclined being ſtill oppreſſed &amp; kept downe by the authoritie of the Pope. Euen iuſt after the ſame manner as it would haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out in other caſes with vs in Fraunce: in as much as the caſe ſo ſtood in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as that matters of ſute and law were pleaded in Latine, and all manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings made in Latine, howbeit that the common people by reaſon of the change that happened, did not vnderſtand it: but that our kings as thoſe which did more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watch ouer the goodes of the people, then the Romiſh Biſhops did ouer their ſoules, haue beene very prouident wiſely to foreſee, and by their ordinances to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the ſame.</p>

The holy ſcriptures of the old Teſtament, ſay they, were written in Hebrew, and thoſe of the new Teſtament in Greeke, and not in any other tongue. Let it bee ſo, and good cauſe why, ſeeing the Hebrew tongue was the language of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to whome the law was properly and peculiarly giuen, and the Greeke likewiſe very common, knowne vnto all the Eaſt parts, where Chriſtianitie did firſt ſpring and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15548:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpread abroad. But what prerogatiue do they ſhew vs why they ſhould ſo aduance and cleaue vnto the Latine? Let them anſwere them that the Goſpell was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding preached by word of mouth in all tongues, and to that end was the gift of tongues ſent vnto the Church: which was no ſooner ceaſed, but that the ſcriptures both of the old and new Teſtament were found as a ſupply of the ſame, tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers tongues, as Hebrew, Syrian, Arabicke, and Scythian, as the eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie doth witneſſe vnto vs: that this diligent indeuour continued and endured by the induſtrie of good paſtors, in ſuch meaſure and ſort, as that the knowledge of Chriſt, gained and got ground in the world.

<note place="margin">Hieronym. in ep. ad Sophron. Gregor. Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch. Alexand. in vita Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt. Sixtus Senenſ. in l. 4. in lit. l. k.

And therefore Chryſoſtome ſayth: <hi>The Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Perſians, Ethiopians, and innumerable other nations, haue the heauenly doctrine tranſlated into their naturall tongues, and by this meanes haue left off their barbarouſnes to play the philoſophers in good earnest.</hi> Theodoret:

                  <hi>Wee ſee commonlie that the points of Chriſtian doctrine are not onelie vnderſtoode of them, which are the chiefe in the Church, and teach the people: but euen of Shoemakers, Lock-Smithes, and thoſe that worke in woole, and of all other ſortes of Artificers, yea and which more is, of al ſorts of women, as Semſters, Chamber-maides, and others which get their liuing with their handie worke, aſwell hauing no learning, as thoſe which haue learning, if any ſuch be. Againe, they which dwell and keepe in the citties, are not onelie become skilfull therein, but in verie good ſort thoſe alſo, that are labourers in the fieldes, as neatheardes, and ſetters of plantes, whome thou ſhalt finde disputing of the holy Trinitie, and of the creation of all thinges, yea, and thoſe more skilfull in the nature of man, then euer was Plato or Ariſtotle.</hi> Now let it bee iudged by this place, if this people had been thus inſtructed and taught by that manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which is deliuered and taught in the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Now it remaineth, that after wee haue done with theſe good Fathers,
<note place="margin">The anſwere of the Councel of Trent. Index lib. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hib.

And as for the Printers, they ſhall looſe the valew of ſuch bookes to be bestowed vpon the poore. Likewiſe it is our meaning that the Regulars ſhall not read or buye them without the permiſſion of their Prelates.</hi> What ſhall wee ſay here or rather what ſhall we not haue to ſay? The old Writers did chide the Laitie as culpable of a notorious crime, for not hauing of Bibles, and here the Pope and his ſhauelinges do puniſh the Laitie for hauing of them, they do confiſcate the Bibles, they forbid them not as a ſinne onelie, but vpon the penaltie of not hauing their ſinnes forgiuen, yea and which is more, the Regulars themſelues vowed by their inſtitution and ordaining to the ſtudie of holie Scripture, are likewiſe ſubiect to the penaltie. I pray you, is it poſſible that one and the ſame ſpirite can ſay and vnſay? And what will follow hereupon then? but that thoſe good Fathers being aſſured of the ſoundnes of their doctrine, did take pleaſure that it might be viewed and looked vpon in the light, and that theſe which auoide and ſhun the ſame, who can doubte but that they do doubt of theirs, as conuinced in their conſciences of abuſe, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and hereſie.</p>
               <p>Now they are not ſatiſfied with hauing their ſeruice in an vnknowne language,
<note place="margin">The ſecret of the Maſſe.</note> as if the ſtrangenes of the language did make it ſo much the more to bee reuerenced,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:15548:99"/>euen as it falleth out in the receipts of coniurations, and witchcraft, whereof we read in Cato, Trallianus, Scribonius, &amp;c. But further they haue added thereunto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and vttering of the principall part thereof, according to their conſtruction, which is that, which containeth the conſecration to bee done ſecretlie and cloſelie, &amp; thereuppon they call it <hi>a ſecret,</hi> and that of purpoſe in ſuch ſort, as that neither the wordes nor the ſound thereof can be vnderſtoode of the people, learning the ſame of the Pagans, who vnder the muttering of certaine ſtrange and vnknowne wordes, concealed and priuilie couered their myſteries: Whereas the glorie of our Maiſter is to publiſh and make open proclamation of his, this great ſecret eſpeciall which hath laine hid from before all worldes, of the ſaluation purchaſed for mankinde, by the blood of his Sonne, whereof he ſaith vnto his Apoſtles: <hi>Preach my Gospell, this good tidings vnto all creatures:</hi> which by name hee would haue publiſhed and repeated at all times in his holy Supper, inſtituted of purpoſe for this end in theſe wordes: <hi>You ſhall ſhew forth the death of the Lord vnto his comming.</hi> But what meaneth this ſhewing forth, but to vtter and ſpeake it ſo lowde, as that it may bee heard and ſo plainely, as that it may be vnderſtood? And what then is there more contrarie to the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy ſupper of our Lord, and to the renewing of the remembrance of his death &amp; paſſion in the Church, then this pretended myſterie? this ſtrange and vnwonted kind of muttering and whiſpering?
<note place="margin">Concil.

But let vs heare notwithſtanding what the Fathers will ſay vnto vs. Saint Paule will that the people ſhould bee able to aunſwere Amen; which they cannot doe, as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeene, except they vnderſtand, and yet a great deale leſſe, if they do not heare.

In the ende, when they can ſay no more, they flie vnto miracles: as that certaine ſhepheardes who had learned theſe wordes by heart, did abuſe them in ſaying them ouer their breade: for which they were preſentlie puniſhed of God: and from thence forward, the church ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that theſe words ſhould not be ſpoken otherwiſe then in ſecret.

By little and little it began to bee more rare and ſeldome, as alſo leſſe frequented and reſorted vnto: inſomuch as that in the end there came but a verie few people to it, yea there was not anie to communicate in the ſame. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors notwithſtanding, to hold faſt their former authoritie, were verie readie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that their alone preſence was profitable, and to this end they went and diſguiſed this ſacrament, and put vpon it the viſarde of a ſacrifice: and cloſed vppe this generall communicating of the faithfull in a particular action performed by the Prieſt. The Prieſt then which was eyther alone with his onely Clearke to aunſwere him, or elſe very ſlenderlie accompanied, beganne to ſpeake with a lower voice: and Tranſubſtantiation comming vpon this ſolitarie condition of the Maſſe, tyed the force of the ſacrament to the pronunciation of words: which the olde Church was alwaies wonte to attribute in parte to the power of Gods ſpirite, and partlie to the faith of the communicants:

And of al this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: ſeeing that the office and charge of the Bb. and Prieſt was but one, and that the Bbs. did not conſiſt in anie thing, as we haue ſeene, but in the diſpenſation of the word and ſacraments, and in the conferring and exerciſing of diſcipline, and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall policie: that there were not beſides theſe any Prieſtes, ſacrificing for the quick and the dead in the Primitiue Church.</p>

But as Gregorie had vndertaken to reduce all the olde Teſtament into the new; changing the Elders into the ſacrificing Prieſtes of the lawe, the Tables into Altars, the ſacramentes into ſacrifices, and the Deacons into Leuites, then there entred an endles peece of worke. And then alſo beganne from time to time theſe prieſtlie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, conſecrate for the action of their Miniſterie, which wee reade to haue beene giuen to Churches, ſometimes by princes, as by Charles the Great, and Lewes his ſonne: as alſo theſe goodly Canons and Rules: that euerie man euen to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould bee apparelled otherwiſe then the common people, and that of theſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes there ſhould be a differenec betwixt thoſe which were to be worn on working dayes, and thoſe which ſhould bee worne on feſtiuall dayes: as alſo that they ſhould bee diuerſe, according to the diuerſitie of feaſtes, as white, blacke, redde, greene, &amp;c. white ones, vpon the feſtiuall dayes of Confeſſors and Virgins; redde ones, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the feſtiuall dayes of the Apoſtles and Martyrs; blacke ones vpon the dayes of affliction and abſtinence: and from Aduent to the Natiuitie of Chriſt, as alſo from Septuageſima ſunday, to the Saturday before Eaſter, greene ones, vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and working dayes: and a thouſande other ſuch like particular obſeruations, which it would bee too long to repeate, wherewith the Romiſh Church hath ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herſelfe from time to time, to holde vp with nouelties, and not to inſtruct in the olde and auncient truth, the poore ſimple people. Through which alſo the Doctors addicted to ſpeculation, as Innocent the third, Durandus in his Rationall and diuerſe others, haue runne themſelues out of breath in allegorizing vppon the veſtmentes of the Maſſing Prieſtes, vppon their ſtoles and tippettes, &amp;c. and in blazoning of the colours, after the manner of the olde Romaines: fonde Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, which the firſt antiquitie did neuer thinke of, but haue beene deuiſed by that antiquitie, which in reſpect of the former is but as a yeſterdayes Noueltie.</p>
               <p>Now it was likewiſe about the ſame time,
<note place="margin">How Vnction and the Order of Prieſthoode grew vp and proſpered.</note> that Vnction grewe to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for a Prieſtlie Order.

By the ſame meanes alſo the zeale of Chriſtians waxed colde, and reſorte vnto the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holie ſupper was rare and ſeldome. So that what through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Biſhoppes buſied with the affaires of this worlde; what through the multitude of Prieſtes, vnable for the moſt parte to teach the worde of God; and laſtlie, through the coldnes and benummednes of the faithfull, in the beſtirring of themſelues in holie exerciſes, all theſe abuſes were bredde and brewed; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that the Biſhoppes and Prieſtes preaching the worde of God no more, and the faithfull repayring to the ſacramentes but certaine times in the yeare, the whole ſeruice was become a hearing, or as the Italians ſaye, a ſeeing of the Maſſe. As alſo that whereas the Bbs. and Elders were wont to be called to the preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Elders from henceforth were not ordained, but onlie to celebrate the Maſſe: which at the firſt they tearmed <hi>to conſecrate,</hi> and afterward <hi>to ſacrifice.</hi> They were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by theſe wordes, <hi>Accipe poteſtatem, &amp;c.

But the ſcripture ſpeaketh plainelie, how that our Lorde ordained and bleſſed marriage from the Creation: he vouchſafed to honour it in the Patriarks, to commaund it to his Prieſtes, to approue it alſo in the Prophetes, the cleare and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt veſſels of Gods ſpirite, hauing an extraordinarie vocation in the Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by ſignes and miracles.

In the new Teſtament our Lord worketh his firſt miracle at the marriage of Cana, the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonis often vſed in the Scripture of the mar riage of Chriſt and his Church. If it had been a worke of the fleſh, as they ſay, would he haue been preſent at it?

<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. Hebr. 13.</note> and that in laying open and pointing out of ſo high and holy an vnion? But furthermore the Apoſtles ſay generally; <hi>Let him that cannot liue continentlie take a wife, the marriage, and bed vndefiled are honourable among all men:</hi> and afterward particularly: <hi>A Bb. and a Deacon muſt be the husbands each of them of one wife, &amp;c. If the Bb. do not gouern his children well, how ſhal he gouern the church of God?</hi> They likewiſe giue caueats and prouiſoes againſt the contrary doctrine; <hi>For it wil come</hi> (ſaith S.

               <p>Ieſus Chriſt was founde preſent at the mariage in Cana of Galilie.

But his heate being quencht, and paſsion ouerpaſt, writing to Oceanus, he pleadeth the cauſe of Carterius Biſhop of Spain, who had had one wife before his baptiſme, and one afterward, ſaying: <hi>For him it is written: Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is honourable, &amp; the bed vndefiled: but for thee who findest fault with him,</hi> (he ſpeaketh of his aduerſaries) <hi>God will iudge the fornicators and adulterers.</hi> Againe: <hi>The Apostle was amongst the Iewes, and the firſt Church of Chriſt was of the reſidue and remainder of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; he knew that it was permitted by law, and accuſtomed amongst the people by the example of the Patriarkes, and of Moyſes, to beget and multiply children by diuers women: yea and this libertie extended euen to the prieſtes: wherefore he ordained that the prieſtes</hi> (Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) <hi>of the Chriſtian Church ſhould not giue themſelues ſuch licence, as that they ſhould haue two or three wiues</hi> (vno tempore) <hi>at one time, &amp;c.</hi> Comming againe afterward to Carteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: <hi>And doeſt thou thinke therefore, that this good man did offend againſt the Apoſtle, who accompteth it amongst the vertues of a Biſhop, that he be the husband of one wife onely?

But this point ſhould not bee to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In the meane time we are not to belieue, as ſome would go about to wrangle out the matter againſt vs by this place of Saint Ierome, diſagreeing with himſelfe, whiles he was caried away with the ſtreame of contention, that we ſhould nouriſh this opinion, that the Biſhop had beene maried, but that he may not bee ſo, derogating and detracting the credite due to other places, wherein he handleth the queſtion, &amp; that of purpoſe and void of all paſsionate affections. Let vs ſay then, for it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by like reaſon, from the coherence and ſcope of the text: that the Apoſtle doth likewiſe vnderſtand, that the Bb. hath beene vigilant, ſober, of good report, giuen to hoſpitalitie, apt to teach, &amp;c. but that he may not be ſo any more. But the holy Ghoſt hath preuented ſuch wrangling and falſe aſſertions, who ſaith: In the preſent time <hi>Let the Prieſt be eſtabliſhed,

And what is it then that can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon, but that all Chriſtians indifferently and without exception ſhould abſtaine from mariage? whereas hee that hath ordained the Biſhoppe, will that hee ſhoulde haue care of the Church the houſe of God, and his owne together.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15548:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>more grieuous maladie, what more to be pittied of the whole Church, then to bee out of the way of holie diſcretion? Wherein you are not lightlie ouertaken, in going about to compell and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly to force them to leade a ſingle life, whome you ought with all gentlenes to exhorte: when against the inſtitution of the Gospell, and that which is ſpoken by the holie Ghoſt, you will notwithſtanding that your priuate decrees bee executed. Of manie,</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>I will tell you of ſome: God in the old lawe permitted the marriage of Prieſtes: and it is not read that he forbad the ſame afterward at anie time: in the Gospell there is mention made of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches, who gelded themſelues for the kingdome of heauen: but euerie man ſaith, our Lord cannot learne this manner of speech. The Apoſtle ſaith, as concerning virgins, I haue no commaundement from the Lord, I aduiſe, &amp;c. And you ought further to conſider that all men are not fit to receiue this counſell: And whereas they ſay, that this place concerneth the Laitie onelie, they lie like hypocrites, in going about to wring the tender teates of the ſcripture; they haue ſucked blood in ſteade of milke. That which the Apoſtle ſaith: Let euerie man haue his wife, hath not I aſſure you anie exception to bee taken againſt it, in reſpect of anie man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee of ſuch as haue vowed chaſtitie, whereunto they are not to bee conſtrained. But the Apoſtle ſaith: It behoueth that the Biſhoppe ſhould bee vnblameable, the husband of one onely wife: and hee ſaith the ſame alſo of Deacons. And to the end that they may not ſay, that this is ment of the church, hee addeth: hee that cannot guide and gouerne his houſe well, &amp;c. Again, you know verie well, that by the decrees of Pope Silueſter, it is ſaide, that the wiues of Deacons muſt be bleſſed by the Prieſt.</hi> (And this by the way is to bee noted, that this Decree of Sylueſters, hath beene raced out of the Decretall and Councels). There hee allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Iſidore in the rule of Clearkes, and that entire and whole, not maimed and mangled as in the Councell of Mentz, the Canon of Gangres, the ſtorie of Paphnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, &amp;c. And whereas they alledge furthermore, <hi>That without chastitie, no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> hee aunſwereth, <hi>Truth, but chaſtitie conſiſteth not onelie in the flower of virginitie, but alſo in the bond and knot of marriage.</hi> And whereas they holde forth S. Gregorie as a ſtrong bulwarke for their defence; <hi>I cannot but laugh at</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>their raſhnes, and I pittie their ignorance: for hee earneſtlie repented himſelf of this dangerous hereſie.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo hee taketh occaſion to make mention, how that S. Gregorie hauing ſent to fiſh his pond, there were brought vnto him more then ſixe thouſande heads of yong children, which drewe deep ſighes from the bottom of his ſoule, cauſed him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this was the iuſt fruite of his forced ſingle life; and to flie from his Decree, to the good aduiſe and counſell of the Apoſtle: <hi>It is better to marrie then to burne: and he added thereunto, it is better to marrie then to giue occaſion of death.</hi> He paſſeth on forward to adulteries, inceſtes and buggeries, wherewith this Decree which was made in his time, made the earth to ſtinke: and further ſheweth, that it was growne to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion amongſt men, that it was better ſecretlie to defile themſelues with whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with manie, then in a good conſcience to liue openlie, and in the ſight of men with one lawfull wife &amp;c. And that in a worde, <hi>to forbid marriage vnto eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is a plague, a Phariſaicall doctrine, a peruerſe ſect, a daungerous hereſie, and intollerable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſcandall to the whole Church, the fulfilling of that which was threatned by S. Paule: That there ſhould riſe a people, that ſhould giue eare to spirites of error, &amp;c. forbidding mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And there upon adiureth him to leaue off and forſake it, euen as he loueth the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and deſireth the vndefilednes of the ſame, and that he would take this reproof in good part, and remember himſelf, that though a Biſhop be more then a Prieſt, yet</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine may be leſſe, and come behind S. Ierome, that is, may be taught by one of leſſe accompt and dignitie. For otherwiſe he feareth that his Holines by this priuate decree</hi> (for ſo hee calleth it) <hi>will bee founde to oppoſe and ſet himſelfe againſt the olde and new Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> That which is here further to bee noted for the proceeding and growth of this abuſe, is, that there were certaine Biſhoppes that being vnmarried deſpiſed others, and to thoſe he ſaith: <hi>Preſume not, neither be proud of your giftes, iudge not another mans ſeruant, beware that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this faire cloake of continencie, there lye not hid manie infamous delightes and pleaſures.</hi> As alſo that in his time, they obtained and got their wils, rather by the franke and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie accord of men, then by the ſwaye and force of anie lawe: and that the Clearkes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15548:111"/>whom they admitted, did promiſe by word of mouth, or by the giuing of them their hand, that they would continue to liue a ſingle life. From which S.

But to the end that no man may thinke that this Epiſtle was made by ſome other to pleaſure and gratifie any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, although the ſtile it ſelfe do ſufficientlie reſolue all ſuch doubt: Pope Pius the ſecond in his Germany alleadgeth it, and reciteth the argument thereof: againe, it hath been ſeen in famous Libraries, before the controuerſies of this time.

And what ſhall then become (and what can our aduerſaries annſwere in this point) of ſo many holy Biſhoppes and Prieſtes, that were married? who haue adminiſtred the ſame in that eſtate? and to all thoſe faithfull people which haue receiued the ſame ſacrament at their handes? ſhall the ſacrament haue beene vnto them in all nations, and for ſo manie ages, an abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and notorious ſacriledge?</p>

For in the thirteenth canon, recorded by Gratian, we reade theſe words: <hi>In as much as we haue knowne, that it is ordained in the Canon of the order of Rome, that ſuch as ſhould be ordained prieſts and Deacons, ſhould declare that they would abſtaine from the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of company with their wiues; we following the ancient canon of the Apostles special care &amp; diligence, and the conſtitutions of the fathers, do decree that loyall and faithfull mariages take place from this time forward, and that the knot of coniunction of prieſtes with their wiues be not diſſolued, as alſo that they ſhall not be depriued of hauing familiaritie with them, in due time. Wherefore whoſoeuer ſhall be found worthy to bee ordained Subdeacon, Deacon, or Prieſt, ſhall not be drawne back, by reaſon of his company keeping with his loyal wife, neither bound in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to promiſe to abſtaine from hauing due familiaritie with her. In like maner it behoueth them which ſerue at the Altar, at the time of the offering of holy thinges, to bee continent in all thinges, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore, <hi>If any man preſume contrary to the authoritie of the Apostolicall Canons, to bereaue the abouenamed perſons of the inioying of their lawfull wiues, let him be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: and as for thoſe who vnder the colour of religion doe caſt off their wiues, let them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated: and if after the ſame they continue obſtinate, let them be depoſed.</hi> Where is to bee noted, that theſe fathers oppoſed againſt the Canon of Rome the Canons of the Apoſtles, and the decrees of the Fathers. But in as much as this Canon did torment them as if they had beene caſt into ſome ſcorching furnace,
<note place="margin">D. 16. C. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo.</note> they haue taken vppon them to maintaine (notwithſtanding their champion Gratian be againſt them) that it was not made and decreed for one of the Canons in the ſixt Councell, making the world belieue, that this Councell was held at two ſeuerall times: and that at the firſt time they did not make any Canons: but at the ſecond onely the fathers begunne therewith, ſaying: <hi>That after the manner of other generall councels going before, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to ordaine and make ſome.</hi> And Peter the Biſhop mentioned by Gratian, ſaith vnto the Biſhop of Nicomedia, that he had a booke containing 102. And Nicaetas Studenſis citeth this ſame for the thirteenth. Nilus likewiſe Archbiſhop of Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, ſaue that he leaueth out this part of it: <hi>Likewiſe it behoueth them that ſerue at the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe it ſeemeth not to hang well together with that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But we haue thsi Canon all whole in Photius his Canon law, &amp; in ſuch tearmes as do giue much light to that of Gratian, and being further expounded by Gentian Heruet, and Perion: in ſo much as that it hath not ſtood them in any ſtead to haue cut it out of the volumes of the Councels. And that wee may not make any moe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions thereof, we will onely obſerue, that in ſtead of this clauſe: <hi>Likewiſe it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, &amp;c.</hi> there is ſet down in the Greek Canon: <hi>Sed vicis ſuae tempore abſtinebunt: That they ſhould abſtaine from their wiues, when their courſe was to do ſeruice.</hi> Againe, the words are much more proper &amp; forcible throughout the whole tenor of the Greeke text, then they are in the Latine tranſlation: whether it came, that Gratian in fauour of the Romaine Church did of purpoſe weaken the ſame: or of the vnſufficiencie of one tongue at all times to expreſſe an other. And it is furthermore not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that Pope Agatho was preſented in this Councell by George of Conſtantinople, and Theophanes of Antioch: which thing Nicaetas being aſſured of, did not let to obiect the ſame againſt Cardinall Humbert, who writ againſt him by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope, and in particular of this matter. Whereupon enſued that which is ordinarily happening in contentions: namely for peace ſake, to remitte and loſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15548:117"/>ſomewhat both of the one ſide and the other, that ſo they may accord in a middle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. For the third Canon debarreth ſuch as haue beene twiſe maried from taking of orders: the twelfth doth except from the general libertie of eccleſiaſticall perſons, the Biſhops: (and ſome make the reaſon there of to be, that the goods of the Church might not bee waſted and ſpent: and yet this not to bee vnderſtood, ſaue onely of thoſe who ſhould marrie after they were called to the Biſhopricke: for the ſixth doth excommunicate ſuch Biſhop whoſoeuer, as vnder the colour of religion ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his wife: as alſo the ſixth doth counſell them who would be emploied in any ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall function, to take a wife before hand; eſteeming it not ſo conuenient to do it afterward: and according to this law, it is to be ſeene practiſed in Greece at this day. But in deed the moſt certaine courſe is to cleaue faſt vnto the law of the Lord, &amp; the Apoſtles Canon: for after that we begin to make the decree of God to bee arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, it is not poſſible for vs to keep within any meaſure. And againe, all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches profeſsing the name of Chriſt, thoſe excepted which are vnder the gouernment of the Biſhop of Rome, haue retained their married Prieſtes, as the A byſſines, Syrians, Armenians, Ruſſians, Muſcouites, &amp;c. And that in ſo much (ſaith Aluares) as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Abyſſines the Canons and Prieſtes haue wiues and children: amongſt the Greekes &amp; Muſcouites, ſaith the Baron of Herbeſtein, according to the Councell of the Canon of Conſtantinople, it is oftentimes ſeene, that Prieſtes and Deacons are oftentimes maried and called to their charges in one and the ſame day: to the end, that amongſt ſo many other markes of Antichriſt, which doe ſo fitly and properly paint out the Church of Rome, as alſo amongſt ſo many liuely repreſentations of the ſpirit of errour working by hypocriſie, it hath yet ouer and aboue this one peculiar and ſpeciall from all other Churches: namely, the forbidding of mariage, foreſpoken by the Apoſtle, and intitled by the ſpirit of God, by the expreſſe name, <hi>Of the doctrine of Deuils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre then haue we alreadie diſcourſed of,
<note place="margin">The ſumme of the ſecond booke.</note> and examined the dependances &amp; circumſtances of the auncient diuine ſeruice, and of the Maſſe, which hath intruded it ſelfe into the place thereof in the Church of Rome: examining what manner of ones they were firſt inſtituted in the Church of God; and after what manner they were obſerued by antiquitie, what new inuentions and deprauations haue enſued thereupon, and at what times, as alſo by what waies and pathes. Wee haue ſeene the Church nowe ſhrowding her ſelfe into ſome pitte or caue of the earth: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to haue ſeated and aſſembled her ſelfe in faire and comely Temples, and that ſuch temples as haue neither altars nor images: then wee haue ſeene altars vſurping the places of the tables for the holy Supper, and after ſome long tract of time, imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the offering vp of a pretended ſacrifice: and we haue ſeene how images be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted for remembrances, at length grew to be worſhipped and adored. And in the end both the one and the other to haue ſo increaſed &amp; proſpered, as that they haue brought the true altar Chriſt vnto nothing, to the offending of the Iewes and to the ſcorne and reproch of the Turks, through the madnes of ſilly miſerable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. We haue ſeene the veſſels of the Church changed, from decencie and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, to great charge &amp; coſtlines; from coſtlines, to be honoured; from honoring, to adoration. In like maner the apparrell and habites of the prieſts, from common ones into peculiar and ſpeciall ones; from indifferent ones, to certaine and vnchangeable ones; from ſimple ones, by degrees into comely ones, yea into a ceremony, into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and into neceſſity: the whole ſeruice in the vulgar tong, ſuch as was vnderſtood of all, euen vnto the infants; common both to prieſtes and people in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſtendome; afterward by the corruptnes, partly of languages, and partly of men, to become vnknown, not vnderſtood of al the people, no not by thoſe which were of beſt vnderſtanding: to the bringing of men thereby to diſpute againſt the ſcriptures, againſt the fathers, againſt reaſon, &amp; againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſence; how that it ſhold be both more profitable &amp; holy for the ſame to continue ſo. We haue ſeen the Bbs. &amp; Miniſters of the Church, ordained to preach and to adminiſter the ſacramentes, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15548:117"/>afterward in ſucceſſion of time, both the ſeruants and their ſeruice baniſhed and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen quite out of place, &amp; the bright burning lampe of Gods word altogether quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Church, the whole ſeruice turned to a Maſſe, and all the charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Prieſtes, to the ſaying of Maſſes, and that for the moſt part with their harts and eares at home, when their tongues are pronouncing the ſame. And in the ende that they might be thought and ſeeme rather then bee holy in deede, from married ones they become vnmaried, and promiſing abſtinence from mariage for euer. And by what degrees? Surely, virginitie &amp; chaſtity in mariage hauing been praiſed as a wel matching paire at the firſt, and as the ſingular gifts of God, and recommended both the one and the other vnto the church, were afterward (in ſteed of this ſeemely and louing yoking together acording to the Apoſtle) oppoſed and ſet the one againſt the other: and the praiſe of the one was neuer thought ſufficient without the diſpraiſe &amp; diſgrace of the other: whervpon it followed that the Bbs. &amp; eccleſiaſtical perſons who firſt were maried, began to put more holines in an vnmaried eſtate: and ſo in things that were free and indifferent, men haue not let to place, both difference and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of excellencie, and therevpon exhortations to eccleſiaſticall perſons to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace abſtinence from marriage, then to binde them to it with faire ſpeeches: and after to compell them thereto by law, and to force it vppon them by ſeuere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and penalties, and in the end, by the depriuing of them of their Offices and Benefices, and by ſhamefullie diſgrading of them. Whereupon ſo much vncleanneſſe enſued, as that the world ſtinketh thereof, as whereby the name of a Church-man is euill ſpoken of, all ouer the world.</p>
               <p>Now it followeth, that we come to the third part, which entreth into the handling of the doctrine of the holy Supper, and conſequently into the doctrine of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>And here I deſire the Reader to be yet both more attentiue and more feruently affected: that ſo he may be the better able to iudge, both where the abuſe is crept in, as alſo where the true vſe is retained, as alſo where prophanenes hath entred, and where the holy Miniſterie &amp; true myſtery is kept and obſerued.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord our God hauing vouchſafed through his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to chuſe vnto himſelfe before all worldes, a people from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, which we call the Church: (which he hath by the ſame grace continued againſt all the changes and mutations which haue happened thereunto: and amidſt all the broiles &amp; confuſions falling out in the world) was purpoſed to bind and tie the ſame vnto himſelfe by certaine holy and conſecrated ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, full of inſtruction and efficacie: by which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually aduertiſed of the dutie which it oweth vnto God, and of the grace of God towards it: euen that grace of God, wherein it pleaſed him, according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his good pleaſure, to giue himſelfe to his Church, namely to his faithfull: and that dutie of man, which in the acknowledging of this grace, he is bound to offer and conſecrate himſelfe wholly vnto God, and that ſo much the more, becauſe he could not finde any thing in his owne nature, that could merite euen the leaſt thing that poſſiblie could or ſhould allure and draw on this grace: nothing, yea on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not any thing but that which ought to prouoke the wrath &amp; curſe of God vpon him. But for as much as the iuſtice of God, and the ſinne of man were (as it were) two extreames, there was requiſite a Mediator to ioyne them together: and that for the ſame cauſe he ſhould hold of the ſaid two extreames, that is, that hee ſhould bee God and man: this is that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, begotten from euerlaſting, before all time, borne notwithſtanding and giuen in his due time. And therefore in this Mediator, all the holy ceremonies of the Church of God, doe take their roote and foundation; whether they bee thoſe which are ordained for to offer vp our holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto God in: (for if our works be not conſidered in the perfection of this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the naturall imperfections cleauing thereunto, will caſt them out of his preſence, &amp; cauſe them to be taken for treſpaſſes &amp; offences; ſo far will it be off, that they ſhould merite and deſerue grace:) or thoſe which are ordained to aſſure vs of the grace of God: for where is the conſcience, which being informed and rouſed vp, be it neuer ſo little by the law of the moſt mighty, yea if it haue neuer ſo ſmall touch &amp; remorce of it ſelf, that can promiſe or perſwade it ſelfe of the grace of God, how good, and merciful ſoeuer he conceiue it to be? yea, which on the contrarie doth not tremble &amp; quake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his iuſt anger, or doeth not thereby condemne it ſelfe, ſaue that it pleaſeth this Mediator to take it by the hand, and to leade it before the iudge, not ſo much to beg
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15548:118"/>or craue any thing for it, as to ſeale vp vnto and graft in it his grace? to ſay vnto it in full aſſurance and confidence: Father this is one of them which thou haſt giuen me, by the merite of my obedience; or rather one of thoſe whom I purchaſed with mine owne blood. Now of them I will not loſe one, take them vnto thy grace:
<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.</note> it is for them Father that I pray and intreate thee: <hi>Keepe them in thy name, let them be one as we are, let my ioy be fulfilled in them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe holy ceremonies are of two ſorts: ſuch as are offered by man to God,
<note place="margin">Sacrifice and Sacraments.</note> are properly called ſacrifices: and thoſe which are giuen by God to man, ſacraments. In ſo much as that to ſpeake properly, we may ſay: that in the ſacrifices, man (as much as he could) was admoniſhed to renounce himſelfe, and to giue himſelfe vnto God: in the Sacraments hee was aduertiſed and aſſured, that God putting off his iuſtice to cloath himſelfe with mercy, did vouchſafe to giue himſelfe vnto him: the people in their ſacrifices, and euery faithfull man making proteſtation to endeuor themſelues to become the people and children of God: God in the Sacraments bearing witnes vnto them, that he vouchſafed to be their God in Ieſus Chriſt, according to his free promiſes, as alſo their father. To be ſhort, a ſacrifice is an acte or worke, by which we acknowledge, in the knowledge of the true God, the whole homage which we owe vnto him, and the faults which in our infirmitie we commit therein. A ſacrament is a holy ceremony inſtituted of God, in which the faithfull are confirmed, by ſignes exhibiting that which they repreſent, of the grace of God promiſed vnto the faithful in the couenant which it hath pleaſed him to make with them. Now on Gods behalfe the couenant halteth not; he is faithfull, farre more readie to offer himſelfe, and to deliuer himſelfe to vs, with all his good things, then we are to hold out our handes to receiue them. But on our behalfe all our actions are maimed, this fleſhlie hart, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the fleſh, cleauing faſt to it ſelfe, cannot offer it ſelfe to him, of or by it ſelfe, he muſt violently draw and pull it vnto him, when he will haue it. And there remaineth nothing in vs of all that which we owe vnto God, beſides the manifeſting and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our knowing of it, and the teſtifying of the ſorrow and griefe which we haue, for that we are not able to render him the ſame; as alſo to acknowledge in our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that all our good things, that all our proſperitie and good ſucceſſe are of God alone, of his bleſsing and of his fauour, and that all that which hee can receiue of vs in ſtead of recompence, are nothing els then our new treſpaſſes; that is, in ſtead of his bountifulnes our ingratitude, and of his benefites, our miſdeedes;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. &amp; 19.</note> in ſaying with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, (a man notwithſtanding according to Gods owne heart:) <hi>My ſoule, thou haſt ſaid vnto the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodneſſe reacheth not vnto thee.</hi> And againe: <hi>Who knoweth O Lord the faults and errours of his life? O cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes.</hi> And this was the cauſe why the old Church had two principall ſortes of ſacrifices: peace-offerings, by which all &amp; euerie one did proteſt, according to the meaſure of increaſe which they inioyed, that all that whatſoeuer they had was of God: &amp; the propitiatory ſacrifices, by the which they did teſtifie all &amp; euery one, that in ſtead of ſo many good thinges which they did receiue, they could not render vnto God any thing but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes and tranſgreſſions, which by the bloud of beaſts ſhed therein, they teſtified and declared to be worthie of death: and by the ordinarie reiterating of the killing of ſo many innocent beaſts, they did giue to vnderſtand, that they could not be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or pardoned, but in the blood of that immaculate lambe, and of the true, onely, eternall and perpetuall propitiatory ſacrifice of the Church, Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding it is here to be noted,
<note place="margin">That the holy Supper may be conſidered both as a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice &amp; a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that although it hath beene already ſhewed, that there is a difference betwixt a ſacrifice and a Sacrament, that yet there are ſome ceremonies in the Church, which may bee conſidered in diuers reſpectes, both as ſacrifices and ſacraments. The Paſchall lambe in the Church of the Iewes, is taken for a Sacrament, and that in as much as it is giuen of God, for a certaine ſigne of ſaluation promiſed vnto the Church, and to euery faithful member in the ſame: as alſo in that, that this blood of the lamb, wherewith the dore poſts are ſprinkled, doth repreſent vnto vs the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which ſprinkleth our ſoules, and remoue
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:15548:119"/>farre from vs and our Chriſtian families, the deſtroying Angell: and therfore it is ſaide: <hi>This blood ſhall be for a ſigne vppon your houſes, that ſo when as I ſhall ſee it, I may paſſe ouer.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding it may bee taken for a ſacrifice of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, in as much as it is commaunded to bee continued for euer, for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and thankſgiuing for the preſeruation of the firſt borne of Iſrael, out of the midſt of all the ſorrow and griefe which they ſuffered in Egypt: as alſo it is a ſigne of the preſeruation of the elect of God in the Church, from out of the midſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of this peruerſe and wicked world. And therefore it is ſaid: <hi>This day ſhall bee a memoriall vnto you, you ſhall keepe the ſame holy in your generations, &amp;c.</hi> As alſo in ſome ſorte for a propitiatorie Sacrifice, in that it was a figure of the true and onely propitiatorie Sacrifice offered by the Sonne of God our high Prieſt, for our ſinnes to God his father vppon the altar of the Croſſe, according to the Euangeliſt his expoſition: <hi>You ſhall not breake a bone of him.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint Paule: <hi>Our Paſſeouer, that is, Ieſus Chriſt ſlaine or crucified.</hi> The ſame may bee ſaid of the holy Supper of our Lord: It is inſtituted for a Sacrament of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, in as much as it is the reall receiuing and communicating of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, truely God, and truely man, deliuered to be put to death vpon the Croſſe for our ſinnes, raiſed againe for our iuſtification, giuen in the vſe of the holy Supper according to his owne inſtitution, for the nouriſhing of our ſoules vnto eternall life. And therefore it is ſaid: <hi>Take, eate, this is my bodie, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you.</hi> And yet it ceaſeth not, conſidered in ſome ſorte, to bee in manner of a ſacrifice, in as much as this is a remembrance of this propitiatorie ſacrifice of our Lord on the Croſſe, according to that which is ſaid: <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee: ſhew forth the Lordes death vnto his comming:</hi> In ſuch ſort, that as the lambe was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certaine manner a propitiatorie Sacrifice, in that it did prefigure him: ſo the holy Supper in like manner, in as much as it bringeth him vnto our remembrances, in that it repreſenteth him vnto vs before the eyes of our faith. And yet further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more of this remembrance, there proceedeth an other ſacrifice, euen the true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe and thankſgiuing, which the Church hath called by the name of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. That is, that when we call to mind, that God hath ſo loued the worlde, or rather the Church, hated of the worlde, as that hee hath giuen his dearely beloued Sonne, the eternall and euerliuing, for the mortall; the iuſt for the vniuſt; to the ignominious and reproachfull death of the Croſſe, to redeeme them from their ſinnes: wee adore the bowelles of his mercies: wee are lifted vppe with a holy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhment, euen into the heauens farre from our our ſelues: wee vtter our cries in a certaine feruencie of faith, from all in generall, ſaying: praiſed bee thou O Lorde, for that thy grace hath appeared in the worlde: for that it hath ſuperabounded in loue, for the ſauing of ſinners: and afterward let vs ſay with Saint Paule, being humbled in our infirmities, but imboldened in his grace, to the appropriating and particular applying of this benefite vnto our ſelues: <hi>Euen the ſinners Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am the chiefe, I, a blasphemer, a perſecutor, and oppreſſor, &amp;c.</hi> And this faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth this ſacrifice vnto our ſelues, it maketh it ſeuerall and peculiar vnto euery one of vs, it maketh vs then to ſay with confidence: No more, <hi>He that eateth the fleſh and drinketh the blood of Christ hath eternall life:</hi> No more, I ſay: <hi>God ſo loued the worlde, as that he hath ſent his ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> For what good doth this ſerue vs vnto, but to increaſe our ſorrowe and griefe: if wee bee not the parties our ſelues? But more boldly with the Apoſtle: <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, I liue, and yet not I, now, but Christ in mee:
<note place="margin">Galath. 2.20.</note> in that I liue in the fleſh, I liue in the faith of the Sonne of God, who hath loued mee, and who hath giuen himſelfe for me, &amp;c.</hi> Thus in remembring this ſacrifice, the ſhamefull death of the Lord, wee acknowledge our ſelues loſt in our ſelues: yea vtterly loſt, ſeeing that for to ſaue mankind, it was requiſite that the Sonne of God ſhould be made man, and expoſe himſelfe to the reuilinges and ſlaunderous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of men. And this knowledge begetteth in vs an acknowledgement of the free mercie of God, which hath giuen vs his onely begotten Sonne, yea who hath giuen
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15548:119"/>vs himſelfe in his Sonne. How can we then do leſſe then offer vp, then ſacrifice our ſelues to him? To offer vp vnto him, as ſaith the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Our bodies a liuing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, holy, acceptable, a reaſonable ſeruice?</hi> In ſuch ſort, as that in the holy Supper wee communicate really and effectually, in the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, euen to the ſucking of life &amp; nouriſhment to our ſoules from the ſame: and this is that which proceedeth from it as a Sacrament. Wee celebrate likewiſe his death, from whom as out of a fountaine wee drawe life, and that the rather, becauſe this his death is our life: in as much as wee haue the propitiation for our ſinnes in his blood: and the celebrating of the remembrance of this propitiatorie ſacrifice, although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what improperly may be called a Sacrifice. Seeing that conſequently vpon the deepe meditation of this high myſterie and vnſpeakable benefit receiued by the faithfull, &amp; adored of the Angels, we enter into a ſerious thankſgiuing, in which we reſolue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and forſake our ſelues, that ſo we may offer vp our ſelues the more freely vnto God, ceaſing from thenceforth to faſhion our ſelues any more according to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, ſeeking rather to tranſforme and chaunge our ſelues, by the renewing of our vnderſtanding, &amp;c. And here we haue another ſacrifice, euen a ſacrifice of peace, in as much as there is a peace concluded betwixt God and the faithfull man; a ſacrifice of praiſe, in as much as all increaſe and proſperitie, are giuen vnto vs by God, and God in this peace. Finally, a ſacrificing of our ſelues in the offering vp of our thankfull heartes, and reſoluing therewithall to liue and die in him, and vnto him, who hath giuen himſelfe for vs, who hath vouchſafed to offer vp his body, and to ſhed his blood for to purchaſe vs life, who giueth vs them in ordinary bread and wine, to nouriſh our ſoules vnto eternall life, Amen.</p>
               <p>And it is not for any other conſideration,
<note place="margin">Wherfore the old writers did vſe this worde Sacrifice.</note> that the olde writers doe ſometimes call the holy Supper a ſacrifice, a Sacrifice of remembrance and thankeſgiuing of the faithfull. And if our aduerſaries doe keepe themſelues within theſe boundes, wee ſhall not neede to reaſon and diſpute about wordes, neither yet refuſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the worde Sacrifice. But and if that they tell vs, that the Maſſe is a ſacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie for the quicke and the dead; wee tell them, that wee would haue them to aunſwere vs, whether they ground it vppon the holy Supper, or els borrowe the inſtitution thereof from els where. If from elſe where, then wee boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch vnto them, that there is no title of the Maſſe in all the holy ſcripture, neyther of any thing belonging thereto, neither yet in the workes of any of the auncient writers: and this wee haue alreadie proued, and ſhall bee able further to proue moſt plentifully, if any thing bee wanting therein. But if they fetch and deriue it from the holy Supper, then wee auouch and ſay vnto them, that it is no propitiatorie ſacrifice: that the Lord did neuer ordaine it for any ſuch ende: that the Apoſtles did neuer ſo teach it: neyther yet that the fathers did ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande it.

               <p>In the meane time wee will note and obſerue by the way, that theſe wordes <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Sacrament,</hi> doe not alwaies keepe the proper limites and boundes: but that ſometimes they runne in their generall ſignification, and are taken ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all holy offices, or for all the ſignes vſed in the Church to ſignifie any thing.

               <p>But that we may not contend about wordes, let vs come to the queſtion, which is: If the Maſſe bee a propitiatorie Sacrifice: and alſo, if the holy Supper in his puritie, were inſtituted for the ſame end, if our Lord Ieſus bee there ſacrificed a new, really and in very deed, for a propitiation of our ſinnes, that is to ſay, for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead, by the Miniſters or Prieſtes, which things we denie, and our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries affirme.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture telleth vs;

<note place="margin">Heb. 9. v. 12.24</note> 
                  <hi>Christ being come to bee our high priest of good thinges to come, &amp;c. not by the blood of goates, or of calues, but by his owne blood, is entred once into the holy places, hauing obtained an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting redemption.

Now wee are of iudgement, that this effectualneſſe is abſolute and perfect in the precious blood of our Lord, that ſo wee may ſtay and content our ſelues with this onely Sacrifice. And as by the ſufficiencie thereof, being oppoſed and ſet againſt the inſufficiencie of all others, the reiterating thereof is excluded; ſo by the perfectneſſe of the Prieſt, oppoſed and ſet againſt the vnperfectneſſe of thoſe before him, all others are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and we tyed vnto one onely, and him reſident and ſitting in the heauens, at the right hand of the father, in whoſe ſacrifice as all ſacrifices haue an end: ſo in his perſon euerie prieſthood is both fully finiſhed and accompliſhed; <hi>One prieſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of Melchiſedech, without father, without mother, without ſtocke or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, without beginning of daies, and without end of life:</hi> that is, which hath not had any ſuch like predeceſſors: neither yet ſhall haue any ſuch like ſucceſſors in the line and tribe of Leui: an euerlaſting prieſt, and therefore one onely: and therefore alſo, not ſucceeded of any other ſacrificing Prieſtes, and much leſſe of any other prieſtes which ſhould bee imployed in the ſacrificing of him: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the cauſe why there were many priestes, was becauſe they were mortall;</hi> becauſe that death would not let them indure. But this prieſt abideth for euer, and God hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the ſame of him by an oath: and therefore he hath an euerlaſting and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall prieſthoode in himſelfe and in the Church. A prieſt which is able to be both the Sacrificer and Sacrifice, together and at once: a holy Prieſt, which hath no neede to offer daily, both for his owne ſinnes, and for the ſinnes of the people: and ſuch a one is Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of the eternall God, and God himſelfe. A Sacrifice alſo perfect and ſufficient: which thing cannot poſſiblie be found in the blood of all the creatures that are liuing, no not in the offering vp of all men, and the whole worlde therewithall: and ſuch a one againe is Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, but man without ſinne, ſeperated and ſet apart from ſinners: the lambe without ſpotte:

For beſides, that this diſtinction hath no warrant in all the ſcripture, the Apoſtle, as if he had forſeene the ſame, cutteth it off in a word: for not being contented to haue gone ouer it oftentimes, how that wee haue propitiation for our ſinnes in the blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt once ſhed: that all manner of other blood is voide and deſtitute of this effectuall power, &amp;c. To the ende that wee

But if they reply: that if this bloodleſſe ſacrifice of theirs bee not propitiatorie, yet it helpeth vs to make application, and to take hold of the true propitiation. Wee anſwere, neuer a deale: for wee are all Prieſtes in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, all annointed by the ſpirite of Chriſt, to repreſent and daylie offer vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, the ſacrifice of his onely Sonne, in the feruencie of our prayers, made in a liuely faith, to the ende that it might pleaſe him, vpon the view of the ſame, to forgiue vs our offences.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow therefore what is there that our aduerſaries can obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this doctrine grounded vpon the anology of the whole bodie of the holy ſcriptures, both of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that by ſo manifold, plaine, and expreſſe places? They tell vs, that the ſacrifices of the law haue in ſuch ſorte ſhadowed out the ſacrifice of our Lord vppon the Croſſe, as that neuertheleſſe they haue not vtterly bereft vs of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sacrifice: and that in very deede the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, is prefigured and foretold in the old Teſtament, and that ſuch a one as they vſe to celebrate at this day, ſacrificing the body and blood of our Lord vnder the kindes of bread and wine vpon their altars. But let vs ſee vppon what ground. In Geneſis the 14. it is ſaid: <hi>Melchiſedech king of Salem brought,
<note place="margin">Geneſ. 14. Melchiſedech.</note> or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wine &amp; bread to be brought: and he was the prieſt of the high God.</hi> They cannot deny, but that this is not the true text in that place: and yet notwithſtanding they gather with a full hand this concluſion: Chriſt is a Prieſt according to the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech; and he brought bread and wine; therefore Ieſus Chriſt hath ſacrificed bread and wine, and vnder bread and wine his body and his blood: and the prieſtes do the ſame daily according to his example. Let vs agree in the grammaticall and literall ſence, and the whole controuerſie in diuinitie, wil be altogether void and ended. The Hebrew word which is vſed there, is neuer vſed in the ſcriptures, about the matter of ſacrifice: &amp; cannot be better expreſſed, then by that which we ſay in French: <hi>To draw forth, ſet forth, or to cauſe to be brought, or to bring forth.</hi> In this ſence wee reade the ſame word for the drawing forth of a ſword, Ezech. 21. &amp; the drawing forth of the windes, Pſalme the 135.

<note place="margin">Poſſenin. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliothec. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. l. 4. c. 14.</note> But the Apoſtle decideth the whole matter, who telleth vs, that Melchiſedech came before Abraham, and bleſſed him. He ſpeaketh not of the bread &amp; wine, he findeth not any ſuch profound myſtery there: he concealeth it, as acceſſarie and priuy to that which went before it: and he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the mentioning of the bleſſing, without making of any other ſtay or delay. Now if the proofe of a Sacrifice do lie in this word, and that this word by the conſent of all interpretors, containeth not ſo much as any ſhadow of a Sacrifice in it: what need we then to ſeeke to proceed or wade any further, to fiſh out long diſcourſes, the fountaine fathered vpon the word, being alreadie dried vp and ſtopped? Graunt it, (ſay they) but yet he bringeth forth bread. But now let them not go about to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that which they know, namely, that the Hebrews vnder the name of bread do comprehend all manner of food and ſuſtenance, which likewiſe the Septuagintes haue tranſlated in this place, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. The Chaldie, <hi>Et erat Miniſter coram Deo.</hi> The coniunction cauſall not being acknowledged by any but themſelues. Caietanus likewiſe: <hi>And wheras it followth in the vulgar tranſlation: For he was the Prieſt, &amp;c. as though this were the cauſe of the offering, the ſame is not ſo in the Hebrew, vz.</hi> Vt cauſa, ſed vt ſeparata clauſula, <hi>that is, not as a cauſe, but as a diſtinct &amp; ſeperated ſentence:</hi> ſo weak &amp; wauering are the foundations of ſo great a building. But &amp; if we make any queſtion here of a ſacrifice, then it muſt likewiſe bee known to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Melchiſedech did offer his ſacrifice? to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? to a man? this cannot but proue impiety; &amp; an abſurditie alſo, when the greater is made to ſacrifice vnto the leſſe. But they will ſay, that hee ſacrificed vnto God? And in conſcience, can they gather any one word to ſhew the ſame? And whether do we reade the holy ſcriptures to gather from thence the thinges it ſpeaketh not of, or to heare therein that which it teacheth? But which is more, the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes vndertaketh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of the Prieſthood of Melchiſedech, with the prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſt. Hee handleth it throughout all the partes thereof, making them both to bee kinges of righteouſneſſe and peace: and making them both alſo to bee permanent and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prieſtes, &amp;c. What could there bee of greater weight and moment, then to ſay: <hi>And he ſacrificed bread and wine,
<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.</note> in token of the ſacrifice which Chriſt offered in his holy Supper? &amp;c.</hi> Hoſius ſaith, and Bellarmine after him; that this myſterie was too great for the Hebrewes to conceiue.
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> But wherefore then had the Apoſtles ſaid before: <hi>Let vs leaue the worde, which deliuereth the beginning of Chriſt, and let vs go on vnto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. &amp;c.</hi> And what could there bee more hard then to ſetre before them a man, without father, without mother, without beginning, and without ending, &amp;c. And if there had beene any darkneſſe therein, of whom could they haue learned the ſame more clearely and plainly, then of the Apoſtle? then of the ſpirit of God himſelfe? And to what time, or for what manner of men, will they ſay, that hee did reſerue the knowledge thereof? But let vs graunt them that he ſacrificed to God bread &amp; wine: this is all that they can gather out of this text with the help of all their falſifications;
<note place="margin">Exod. 29. Numb. 28.</note> and what ſhal they gaine thereby? For firſt, is this any other thing but that which the Prieſtes according to the order of Aaron did euery day? And wherein then will the excellencie and prerogatiue, that the Apoſtle ſeeketh after,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15548:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>be found? ſeeing namely, that they hold, that in reſpect of the mater the ſacrifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Melchiſedech, is not any thing more precious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſacrifices of the Leuits:
<note place="margin">Veg. de Miſſa The. 68. fol. 33</note> and that the death of our Lord was more amplie and liuelie figured out in theſe, then in that. And afterwarde, if it muſt needes bee, that becauſe that Melchiſedech offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bread and wine, became the figure of Chriſt, and that Chriſt may bee offered vnder the kindes of bread and wine; then why not aſwell vnder all the other kindes, which did repreſent him vnder the law, being offered by the Prieſtes according to the Order of Aaron, which in like manner did figure and ſhadow him out? And again, if this ſacrifice were the figure of Chriſt, hath hee not accompliſhed the ſame, as hee hath done all the reſt? And then what remaineth there yet behinde to bee done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine therein? to what end ſhould there neede a reiterating of that which is perfect? and when hee himſelfe hath giuen this teſtimonie, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> who ſhall gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay and denie the ſame, ſeeing that hee came to fulfill them all? But let vs ſaye on; They compare Chriſt to Melchiſedech, Melchiſedech his offring to the Euchariſt; now betwixt the Offerer and the offring there is alwaies a proportion to bee kepte. As therefore there is not any Prieſt. that can aſſume and chalenge to himſelfe, to inioye and holde the Prieſthoode of Chriſt according to the Order of Melchiſedech: ſo in like manner it cannot poſſibly bee, that anie ſhoulde bee founde to whome it might bee attributed to offer the Euchariſt: and if Melchiſedech, did offer breade and wine, then it was the ſubſtance thereof, and not the accidents or qualities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithſtanding in the Maſſe, there is nothing offered but the accidentes: why therefore doe they alleadge Melchiſedech, if they will holde themſelues vnto the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure? And wherefore likewiſe doe they hold Tranſubſtantiation in the Maſſe? In a worde, though they ſhould bee able to proue this ſame to bee a ſacrifice, yet could they neuer proue it but a ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing, or peace-offring, and not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice propitiatorie: for it is ſaide, that Melchiſedech ſaid vnto Abraham: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath giuen thine enemies into thy hand, &amp;c.</hi> wordes all of them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Thankeſgiuing, and containe nothing in them of any ſacrifice for ſinne, neither therefore the Maſſe of any propitiatorie ſacrifice, if this bee a figure thereof. Againſt all this which we haue ſaide, they obiect certaine places out of the old Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But what will they ſaye, if they bee ſhewed the contrarie, if all thoſe likewiſe which ſpeake of offering, ſay, that Melchiſedech offered bread and wine to Abraham; to whome hee that bleſſed him had no regard or purpoſe to offer vppe any ſacrifice. Clemens Alexandrinus: <hi>Melchiſedech gaue ſanctified bread and wine for food and ſuste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as a figure of the Euchariſt.</hi> Marke, <hi>He gaue,</hi> that is, to Abraham, and not <hi>he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:</hi> and the word, <hi>food or refreſhment that followeth, proueth it ſufficientlie.</hi> S.

For as for all the reſt, they haue not ſpoken anie otherwiſe. S. Ierome ſaith: <hi>Melchiſedech had prefigured the ſacrament of the bodie and blood, in the bread and wine which he offered.</hi> S. Auguſtine, <hi>Offertur ſub ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdote Chriſto, quod protulit Melchiſedec, &amp;c. The ſame is offered vnder Chriſt the Prieſt, which Melchiſedech brought forth.</hi> Where is to bee noted the difference that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15548:123"/>betwixt <hi>Obtulit</hi> and <hi>Protulit,</hi> Saint Ambroſe ſpeaking of the breade and wine of the holie ſupper: <hi>Wee haue knowne the figure and ſhadowe of theſe ſacramentes, ſince the time of Abraham.</hi> And ſo likewiſe haue others. But Lombarde thus: <hi>The Prieſts take the cuppe with wine, and the diſh with the hoſtes, to the ende that they may know, that they receiue power to offer vnto God ſacrifices of attonement and reconciliation: and this order deſcendeth from the ſonnes of Aaron.</hi> And why now doe they obiect vnto vs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech? Seeing alſo it is moſt certaine, that wee are to holde our ſelues bound by due and ſounde dealing, not to allegorize ſo lightlie vpon theſe or thoſe places, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie againſt a cleare and euident doctrine, ſuch as wee haue proued this to bee, out of the Epiſtle vnto the Hebrewes.
<note place="margin">Idem contra lib. Petil. c. 16. D. 9.</note> S.

And indeed it is not to be concealed, that there are ſome which doe ſo farre delight and ſport themſelues with this place, as that they let not to ſaye, that Melchiſedech was either an Angell, or the holy Ghoſt, or the Son of God himſelfe.

               <p>Now followeth the Paſchall lambe, They will haue it to be a figure of Chriſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed either in the ſupper, or vpon the Altar of the Maſſe.

S.

                  <note place="margin">Iohn 19. Exod. 12.

Iohn in more plaine and euident manner ſaith: <hi>To the end that the ſcripture might bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that not one of his bones ſhall bee broken.</hi> And this was fulfilled vpon the Croſſe, not at the Table, as likewiſe it ſhould not bee vpon the Altar of our aduerſaries: though the Canon <hi>I Berengarius,</hi> were belieued, which will that he ſhould be broken and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with teeth, as euerie man knoweth. The Paſchall Lambe then is not properlie the figure of Chriſt eaten in the holy ſupper, but of Chriſt crucified: although that in the holy Supper there be celebrated the ſaluation which wee reape by his death, as in the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, there is celebrated and remembred the deliuerance out of Egypt. Let vs admit that the paſchall Lambe was a figure of the Euchariſt: what will follow thereupon? That as the Lambe (ſay they) was ſacrificed vppon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo Chriſt ſhould be vpon the Altar. But rather let vs ſay: The Paſchall Lambe to ſpeake exactlie, had neuer granted it the roome of a ſacrifice: It had not the throat cut by the Prieſtes, neither yet vpon the Altar. And againe they ſay, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine a ſacrifice, that it is meete that <hi>Ab electo Ministro offerat ur, that it ſhould be offered by the Miniſter choſen for the purpoſe, &amp;c.</hi> But in this action the Maiſter of the familie performed that dutie, and beſprinkled with the blood thereof the poſts of his houſe, and his familie did eate it. And that this is the truth, the Iewes, wiſe, and well ſeene in the law, did not ſacrifice out of Ieruſalem, and yet notwithſtanding, they did continue euermore in all their remouinges from place to place,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. l. 8. c. 10. &amp; de Geneſ. allegor. l. 1. Exod. 8.</note> out of Ieruſalem to eate the Paſchall Lambe. And Moſes likewiſe putteth a manifeſt diſtinction therein: for when Pharao permitted him to ſacrifice in Egypt, hee aunſwereth, that it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>wfull, and yet it was lawfull for him to eate the Paſſeouer there. But let vs likewiſe grant that it was a ſacrifice, it ſhall then bee requiſite for the accompliſhing of the figure, that Chriſt ſhould bee ſacrificed a new. But the Apoſtle did not vnderſtand
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15548:123"/>it ſo when hee ſaide: <hi>Our Paſſeouer is ſacrificed, &amp;c.</hi> It ſhall be requiſite that his blood ſhoulde bee ſhedde: for otherwiſe how ſhould a ſacrifice made with the ſhedding of blood, become a figure of their pretended ſacrifice, made without bloode? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it ſhall bee forbidden them to keepe or reſerue anie thing of the Euchariſt; for ſo did the law ordaine concerning the Paſſeouer. Ieſus Chriſt likewiſe (a thing that cannot be vttered without blaſphemie) ſhall either haue left this ceremonie of the law vnaccompliſhed, or elſe but ſleightlie and vnprofitablie accompliſhed. Now in theſe their perplexities and caſes of doubt, they haue no manner of refuge but to the Fathers: but let vs ſee vpon what good groundes or reaſons. The Fathers (ſaye they) haue ſpoken of the Lambe, as the figure of the Euchariſt: well, let it bee ſo.

                  <hi>The lewes did celebrate the Paſſeouer: but they know not the vnspeakeable myſteries contained vnder theſe ſhadowes: That the Sonne of God hauing cloathed himſelfe with humaine fleſh, was to bee ſlaine, and to ſet at libertie the whole worlde: That hee ſhould giue his blood to be drunke both to the Grecians and Barbarians: That he ſhould open the heauens to all men: That hee ſhould aduance and lift vppe this fleſh vnto heauen, and ſet it at the right hand of the Father, &amp;c.</hi>

<note place="margin">Iren. l. 4. c. 32.</note> that hath ſo much as once thought vpon it. Ireneus ſaith: <hi>Chriſt giuing aduice and counſell vnto his Diſciples, to offer vnto God the firſt fruites of his creatures, not as of anie neceſsitie in God, but that they might not bee vnthankefull and vnfruitfull, tooke that which by creation is bread, and gaue thanks, ſaying: This is my bodie &amp;c. teaching that the ſacrament of the new Teſtament is new.</hi> And hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereto: <hi>Which the Church taking from the Apoſtles, offereth throughout the whole world vnto God, the firſt fruites of his giftes, to him that giueth whatſoeuer foode and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we haue.</hi> That is to ſay, becauſe that the auncient Chriſtians were wonte to offer of their fruites vnto God, as wee haue ſeene heretofore, by many places out of the ſame Ireneus: and from out of them, they tooke the bread and the wine, which were diſtributed in the holy Supper, the remainder being giuen to the poore, or conuerted to the neceſſarie vſes of the Church. The queſtion then that riſeth hence, is of the ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing, and not of a propitiatorie ſacrifice: of the ſacrifice of fruits and things without life, and not of the reall ſacrificing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: of a ſolemne thankeſgiuing for good thinges receiued: and not of anie attonement or appeaſing of Gods wrath for ſinnes committed. And indeed Ireneus ſayeth in an other place; <hi>Euerie where incenſe &amp; pure ſacrifices are offered to my name. S. Iohn in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps, hath called the praiers of the Saints, the offerings of incenſe.</hi> And again, <hi>In aſmuch,</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>as the Church offereth in ſimplicitie and ſinglenes of heart, their offering vnto God is by good right, reputed a pure &amp; vndefiled ſacrifice, as S.

But afterwarde, <hi>This is then</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſacrifice that I haue spoken of before, euen this miſticall and spirituall gift, whereof Saint Paule speaketh: Bee yee followers of God, as welbeloued children: and walke in loue, euen as he hath loued you, and giuen himſelfe for you vnto God, for a ſacrifice and offering of a ſweete ſmell and ſauour:</hi> and this ſacrifice hee calleth, <hi>The gift of ſaluation:</hi> namelie, becauſe thereby wee renewe the memorie of Ieſus Chriſt ſacrificed and crucified for vs: binding vs in the bondes of charitie by his owne example, towardes our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which are his members, and ſo wee are made one with him in the receiuing of this holie myſterie, that is ſacrificed and crucified in him, and with him, in his death and paſſion, inaſmuch as hee hath ſuffered for vs, and not for himſelfe: that ſo alſo wee might riſe vnto glorie with him. Saint Auguſtine alleadgeth this place againſt the Iewes:
<note place="margin">Auguſt de Ciuit. Dei. l. 18. c. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſacrifice</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>is that which is offered throughout the whole world, by the Priesthoode of Chriſt, according to the Order of Melchiſedech, the Iewes could not deny it, and therefore why doe they waite or looke for an other Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> But wee ſtill ſtande in doubte, whether this bee a ſacrifice of praiſe, or of propitiation, except that hee can likewiſe ridde vs of this ſcruple. <hi>The church</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>ſacrificeth to God, in the body of Chriſt the ſacrifice of praiſe, ſeeing that the God of Gods hauing spoken, hath called the earth from the Sunne-riſing, vnto the ſetting thereof. For this church is the ſpirituall Iſraell, diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the carnall Iſraell, which ſerued God in the ſhadowes of ſacrifices, in which was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſet forth this ſingular ſacrifice, which Iſraell now offereth according to the spirite, &amp;c. Out of the houſe of this Iſraell hee hath not taken anie calues: for in it are ſacrificed and offered vnto God the ſacrifice of praiſe. In euerie place</hi> ſayeth hee afterwarde, <hi>incenſe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto my name: And Saint John expoundech it in the Apocalyps, the prayers of the Saintes.</hi>

               <p>Thus now you may beholde and ſee what it is that theſe men alleadge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of the olde Teſtament, namelie, figures, allegories, and generall ſpeeches, as alſo the Doctors vpon theſe places, by which they woulde make men belieue, that whereſoeuer they haue vſed this worde <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> they meante and vnderſtoode it of their <hi>Maſſe.</hi> And yet the Latines themſelues foure hundred yeares after our Sauiour Chriſt, had not ſo much as heard of the name. That they haue acknowledged and taught their propitiatorie ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead, and yet they doe not acknowledge anie ſacrifice for ſinnes, but in the propitiation which wee haue in the bloode of Chriſt, neither yet anie Sacrifice in the holy Supper, ſaue onelie that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee doe celebrate the memorie of this great Sacrifice, and offer vppe praiſe and thankeſgiuing vnto God for ſo great a benefite: there wee ſacrifice and offer vppe our ſelues to his ſeruice a liuing ſacrifice, and conſecrate our ſelues for our brethren, the members of Chriſt, and of one and the ſame bodie with vs, in true charitie, in the beholding of the Creator and Redeemer, and the giftes which wee haue receiued from him. And now it followeth that wee make triall, if they haue anie better grounde for this their pretended ſacrifice in the new Teſtament, wherein there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not anie more queſtion of ſhadowes and figures, and wherein if it bee nothing but a ſillie ſleight repreſentation, if it be nothing but an intricate and infolded thing, if it bee not altogether plaine and cleare, aſſuredlie, wee may bee bolde to ſay, and that without any doubt, that it is but an humaine inuention, yea and therefore that it is not there to bee found at all.</p>

God ſhall bee adored and ſerued in ſpirite, no more in one place but euerie where, no more in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of beaſtes, but in the ſacrificing of our ſelues. Therefore the Maſſe is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice propitiatorie for the ſinnes of men, therefore the Maſſe muſt bee ſaide euerie where, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But they come nearer vnto the point, and giue an inſtance from the inſtitution of the holy ſupper: and this is alſo our proper part and poſſeſſion. It is ſaid:
<note place="margin">Luke 22. 1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee:</hi> and <hi>to doe</hi> in the ſcripture, ſignifieth ſometimes <hi>to ſacrifice.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter here in hand muſt needes bee a ſacrifice. And our Lord had taken the bread and the cup, and had ſaide: <hi>This is my bodie, This is my blood,</hi> therefore he did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnder the kindes of bread and wine, his body and his blood vnto God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and by vertue of theſe wordes iuioyneth all ſucceeding Prieſtes to doe the like: a worlde of errors, cauillations, and falſe ſurmiſes in a verie few wordes. And the long time ſince they were confuted and ouerthrowne, in all theſe their argumentes, might haue bin ſufficient to haue cauſed them to ceaſe from the vſing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any more:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:15548:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Facere</hi> in Latine ſignifieth <hi>to ſacrifice:</hi> but by an abridging of the language, <hi>to doe ſome holie thing:</hi> but that this is more vſuall in the writinges and workes of Poets, then of Orators, and that ſeldome, not often, and onely then, when the mater in queſtion doth manifeſtlie appeare to be about a ſacrifice: (as I ſay) may euidentlie bee ſeene, &amp; needeth not to be geſſed at. And here therefore we ſtand vppon the quite contrarie: As that the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is neuer vſed <hi>to ſacrifice,</hi> as far off is <hi>faire</hi> in the French tongue: but the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles writ in Greeke. So that the controuerſie here is about an ordinarie or common, and not anie picked or vnwonted phraſe: the contention is not euidentlie and manifeſtlie of a ſacrifice: for it is ſo farre from appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues as that the ſharpeſt ſighted Fathers did know nothing therof. And further the Hebrew word Aſa, (and how much more the Greeke) doth neuer ſignifie to ſacrifice, but when a ſacrifice or oblation doth follow it: as <hi>facere haedum agnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>facere haedo agno, &amp;c. to offer a kyd, a lambe, &amp;c.</hi> their interlineall Gloſe is not acquainted with this ſubtill ſhift. <hi>Hoc facite, that is,</hi> ſaith it: <hi>At oft as you ſhal eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ſhew forth the death of the Lord vntill his comming.</hi> But let vs admit that it is ſo; <hi>Hoc facite, ſacrifice this:</hi> what ſhall we make then of it? To ſacrifice the bodie of Chriſt? But Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Which is giuen for you,</hi> and <hi>to giue,</hi> is not <hi>to ſacrifice.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not the ſame action which Chriſt performed, for a man to ſacrifice, if Chriſt did not ſacrifice. And afterwarde; <hi>Which is giuen,</hi> that is, which is now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtant giuen, and deliuered vp to bee crucified for vs. The olde tranſlation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Councell of Trent, hath tranſlated it, <hi>Dabitur,</hi> and not <hi>Datur,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſame to his ſuffering vpon the Croſſe, and not to the holy ſupper. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome and Origen: <hi>Dabitur, effundetur, which ſhalbe giuen, which ſhall bee ſhedde and offered vppe.</hi> And Chryſoſtome addeth the reaſon, how that for the comforte of his Diſciples, our Lord taught them, that his paſſion was the myſterie of the ſaluation of mankind: the Maſſe alſo enemie vnto it ſelfe in this point, hath read it ſo. Let vs ſay then that theſe wordes, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> haue relation to the inſtitution of the ſupper, and that by them wee are inioyned to doe the ſame that he hath done, as to bleſſe the bread, to eate the bread, to bleſſe the cuppe, and to drinke the cup, to diſtribute them both, and to receiue them both. But as for the matter of ſacrifice, there was none but vpon the Croſſe: The communicating of him and his graces, and the action of thanks, is ordained &amp; inſtituted to be practiſed at this Table, and vpon this Croſſe, hee hath borne our iniquities vpon this Croſſe, he hath beene broken for our ſins. <hi>God forbidde</hi> (ſaith S. Paul,) <hi>that I ſhould euer glorie but in this Croſse.</hi> If then this be to ſacrifice the bodie, then it is not, <hi>hoc facere, to doe that which Chriſt hath done:</hi> who tooke the bread, who diſtributed it, who performed not in all this anie action of a ſacrifice: but if it be thus: Do that which I haue done, then it muſt not bee anie worke of ſacrificing, here will not bee found any ſacrifice: and ſo there muſt needes follow as poore &amp; ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diuinitie, as the Grammer or ſence that went before, was poore and ſlender. To be ſhort, if <hi>faire</hi> in that place, bee to ſacrifice, it is ſaide; <hi>Doe this as oft as yee ſhall drinke it, &amp;c.</hi> by which reaſon it ſhould follow, that the ſacrifice hath no place, but at ſuch times as a man doth drink. And yet they ſay, that the Sacrifice &amp; Tranſubſtantiation doe goe before. And againe, if it were ſaide vnto all thoſe which were ſitting at the Table with our Lord, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> then the commandement of ſacrificing was generall to all: for in like manner vnto all in general, euen to all the whole Church of Corinth, S. Paul ſaid, <hi>Hoc facite.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And the Prieſtes by this account, ſhall haue as weake a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their places, as the ſacrifice hath. But who can better expound this place then S. Paul, <hi>Do this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in remembrance of mee? And how? For as oft as you ſhall eate of this bread, and drinke of this cuppe, you ſhall ſhew forth the death of the Lord vntill his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming.</hi> Not by ſtanding &amp; gazing on, in a fond ſort, not by the means of an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude or play, neither yet by any ſuch apiſh fooleries: but by a ſerious &amp; earneſt, either meditation, or laying open of the horror of our ſinnes, and of the mercy of God, who hath ſo greatlie loued the world, as that hee hath vouchſafed to giue his Sonne to the death of the Croſſe, for vs miſerable ſinners, to the end that he that belieueth in him,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:15548:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>may haue eternall life. And this is the ſame with that which their Gloſe ſaith: <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> For ſaith it, <hi>the ſacrament ought to be receiued in the remembrance of the Lordes paſſion: ſhew forth the Lordes death, &amp;c. that is to ſay, make your account and ſet it down for certain, that the ſuffering and death of the Lord came through you.</hi> For <hi>Whoſoeuer</hi> (ſayeth Oecumenius) <hi>ſheweth forth this death, he displayeth and maketh a ſhew of all manner of gifts, and of all manner of loue towardes men, yea in a worde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Oecum. in 1.

               <p>A great man of this time, ſeeing himſelf thruſt out of this place,
<note place="margin">Genebrard.</note> hath inuented this ſhift, namelie to ſay, that the Apoſtles did ſay their firſt Maſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day of Pentecoſt. And this hee would tug out by the haire, both out of a place of Deuteronomie, where mention is made of the offering of new fruites, which then was ordained in the lawe; as alſo from the 2. of the Actes, where theſe wordes are:
<note place="margin">Act. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>They did perſeuere in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles, in communicating and breaking of bread, and in prayers,</hi> which wee haue alreadie ſufficientlie refuted. For what agreement is there betwixt any thing therein, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, for the remiſſion of ſins? And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we will further take the paines to call to minde,
<note place="margin">Hugo Card. in Act. c. 2.</note> what their Gloſe ſaith vpon this place of the Acts; <hi>Of bread, aſwell common as conſecrated, that is to ſay, aſwell ordinarie, as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall.</hi> And Cardinall Hugo after the ſame manner. And Lyranus: <hi>Partly</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>becauſe they did communicate euerie day: partlie alſo, becauſe they did eate together in common.</hi> And Oecumenius ſayeth; <hi>This is for to ſhewe the ſimplicitie that they vſed in liuing and conuerſing together.</hi> And the Syrian and Arabick interpreters: <hi>They receiued the Communion or Euchariſt, Vchariſto.</hi> And Caietanus: <hi>This is to ſhewe the diſtribution of the meat, as it was practiſed from familie to familie.</hi> So that on euery ſide the ſtanding of the Maſſe, doth ſtill faile and deceiue it.</p>

And ſurely vpon good cauſe &amp; warrant, ſeeing it is a holy &amp; conſecrate action, and that the ſpirituall ſacrifices of our heartes are thereby ſacrificed to God, vnto repentance, as alſo ſeeing that the incenſe of our praiers, and the calues of our lips, and the Goſpell, the word of God, as ſaith S.

So after that thoſe great lightes of the church, which tooke their brightnes from the true light of the Goſpel, had runne their courſe, yet there remained ſome glimſes of that their brightnes a long time after, notwithſtanding that they were ſmothered and ſtifled with the palpable fogs of blinde ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and although they were violently forced by a contrary ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to do the thing they were neuer ordained for.

                  <hi>Howbeit we offer ſacrifices euerie day, yet it is no other then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording &amp; renewing of the memory of the death of Chriſt, &amp; therby we offer but one ſacrifice, not manie, for hee was onelie once offered, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, <hi>All that we doe is but the renuing of the remembrance of his death.</hi> Againe, <hi>Our Lordſaide, Take, eate, and ſacrifice, offer vnto God.</hi> And <hi>S.</hi> Paule to the ſame ende: <hi>That the Saintes were perfected by one onely oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And this hath come to paſſe within this thouſand yeares: ſo hard and difficult a thing it is, to bring the learned to ſpeake the language of the Maſſe, though the abuſe and miſchiefe be alreadie brought in.

               <p>But now ſince the yeare fiue hundred vntill this time, it hath ouerrunne great &amp; large Dominions, and yet by certaine degrees, and by the concurring of diuerſe cauſes. During the feruent and deuoute zeale of the Chriſtian Church, the holie ſupper was celebrated euerie Lordes day,
<note place="margin">Carol. Mag. l, 7. c. 138.182 167.</note> yea in ſome Churches euerie daye, and the number of Communicantes was ordinarilie verie great: whereby wee haue ſeene herefofore, that in populous Churches and congregations, there haue beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed at one time, diuerſe great loaues, and diuerſe great cuppes of wine. This zeale together with the time, grew luke-warme. whereupon wee ſee that S. Ambroſe and S. Chryſoſtome are greatlie grieued to ſee: <hi>That it was their dutie to attend at the Lordes Table, and that no man haſted to come thereto, &amp;c.</hi> Inſomuch alſo as that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions manie and diuerſe being vſed to draw the people thereunto, but profiting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there were diuerſe Canons made to binde and inforce the people thereunto, as alſo ciuill lawes, <hi>Let all the faithfull communicate and ſtaye the Maſse, without anie more bidding,
<note place="margin">L. 2. c. 45.</note> yea, at the leaſt, let them not faile to communicate on the Lordes daye, &amp;c.</hi> But whether it were the obſtinacie or careleſnes of the Paſtors, or both, that were the cauſe, theſe Canons profited little. In the ende there was a lawe made: <hi>That ſuch Laye people as did not communicate at the leaſt euerie feaſt of the Natiuitie, Eaſter, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide,
<note place="margin">Add. 3.38.</note> ſhould bee held for infidels:</hi> and ratified afterward in the Actes and Statutes ſet forth by Charles the great: thus the Table of the Supper ſtoode ſolitary, and as a reiected and forlorne thing for the moſt part, at leaſt in reſpect of the Laitie. The ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons continued their communicating for ſome time, and ſo there ſtill remained a certaine forme of Communion or Euchariſt. But ſhortlie after looſenes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15548:135"/>laide holde vpon them alſo, as it had done before of others. Whereupon we ſee that the Church is conſtrained to make Canons; <hi>That at the least three or foure ſhould alwaies communicate with the Prieſtes:</hi> The printes whereof are as yet in the Abbye of Clugny, where the Deacon and Subdeacon doe receiue the Communion, as yet vnto this day, together with the Prieſts. But afterward theſe three were ſhufled vppe into one, this one was hee, that rung the bell, whome they called the Sexten.
<note place="margin">Camp nariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> And this coldnes did ſtill ſo encreaſe, that Charles the great is conſtrained to make a lawe,
<note place="margin">L. 5. c. 93. &amp; l. 6. c. 118. Add. 2. c 7.</note> by which the Prieſt after hee hath conſecrated, is bound to communicate, becauſe that euen hee himſelfe did oftentimes abſtaine: and there are manie olde Canons to that purpoſe. Thus the vſe of the Communion was loſt by degrees, this Communion (I ſay) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſtians were admoniſhed, and put in minde of practiſing true charitie, by the ſubſtance of the bread which conſiſted of manie cornes, wrought vppe into one loaf; ſeeing thy bee manie members of one bodie, liuing vnder one heade, euen Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, and ſo proportionablie, the ſacramentes themſelues fell into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as namelie, the bread from manie loaues to one, and from a great one to a little one, no bigger then would ſerue being deuided, onelie for three perſons: and in the ende as wee now ſee, to breade no bigger then a penie. And the wine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie, ſo as it might fit the other, from great veſſels vnto little pots, ſuch as ſerue at the Maſſe, from manie cups to one, from a great one to a little one. And it is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to bee noted, that this abuſe had his abode onelie in the Church of Rome; all other Churches, as thoſe amongſt the Abiſſines, Armenians, Syrians, Grecians, Muſcouites, &amp;c. hauing retained, and retayning the Communion, as yet vnto this daye. Now it fell out alſo that the people no longer communicating in the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, became negligent in other partes of their accuſtomed ſeruice, and particularlie, in that of bringing of offeringes, which conſiſted according to the Canons in breade and wine, from which was taken what was neceſſarie to bee imployed in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for thoſe offerings ceaſing it was a cauſe that the Communion alſo ceaſed.
<note place="margin">Carol. l. 1.5.94. &amp; 152.</note> And indeede we ſee that this law is oftentimes renued by Charles the Great, namelie, <hi>That the people ſhould be warned to communicate, and bring their offeringes euerie Lordes daye.</hi> For that the one did ceaſe to bee, becauſe of the other, and thereupon alſo the reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the one was with the more honeſtie, by reaſon of the other. Wherefore to cheriſh them vppe both in deuotion, as alſo in liberalitie, they were giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Maſſe did not onely benefite and ſerue them, by their communicating in the Sacrament in it, but that the principall point of comforte vnto them thereby, was yet behinde; namelie, the ſacrifice, in the merite whereof they had part, inaſmuch onelie as that they were preſent thereat: prouided euermore, that they for their partes brought their ſacrifices, that is to ſay, their offeringes with them. There was alſo a continued courſe of offering vnto them the conſecrated bread, which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if any man would ſay, one gifte for an other, the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine their contentation, and this they diſtributed after it was conſecrated by a praier, whereas before it had beene giuen them for common bread. In the lawes of Charles the great, it is inioyned; <hi>That they ſhould make the people to vnderſtand, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waies the Maſſe doth profite them, aſwell in respect of themſelues, as of their friendes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead or liuing:</hi> and this they call <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>im Miſſae, the force and efficacie of the Maſſe,</hi> and together therewithall to make them the better to vnderſtand the efficacie of <hi>Memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; wherein</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>prayer is made for the Soules, aſwell of them which offer, as of thoſe, which belong vnto them:</hi> aſſuredly, becauſe that otherwiſe the Maſſe would bee forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and caſt off. Where it is likewiſe further to bee noted, that it was not then ſaide in the Canon: <hi>For whome wee offer vnto thee,</hi> but <hi>which offer vnto thee:</hi> the Prieſtes hauing afterward taken to themſelues this prerogatiue of offering, to the debarring and ſhutting out of all others, for hauing anie dealing in the ſame, whereas it was the worke of the people at the firſt properlie which did offer. From that time forwarde alſo, the office of the Prieſt in the Latine Church was brought to haue his Maſſe book much altered and corrected, that ſo hee might ſing the Maſſe. And thereupon alſo
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15548:136"/>was the bread of the Sacrament called ſinging bread: and the exerciſe of a Chriſtian reſtrained to the hearing onelie of the Maſſe, or elſe, as they ſay in Italie, to the ſeeing of it: things vnheard of, and meere ſtrangers in the Primitiue Church, a long time after Gregorie the firſt, although that a great parte of the abuſes may bee attributed vnto him, inaſmuch as hee eſtabliſhed the new ſeruice, framed and ſet forth by one named Scholaſticus, who applied the olde ſeruice to a new vſe, the old prayers to the abuſes and corruption of the time.</p>
               <p>Now for the fortifying of this pretended ſacrifice, manie thinges doe concurre. The worde <hi>Sacrifice</hi> vſed in the Church, after the manner of the olde lawe, to ſignifie the giftes which were offered to God by the people, as it hath beene prooued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, for theſe offeringes were commonlie called oblations and ſacrifices, and this is confirmed by Pope Gelaſius his ordinance: <hi>That the ſacrifices which ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the people at the Maſſe, ſhall be diſtributed into foure partes, that is, for the Biſhop, for the Cleargie, for the poore, and for the maintaining of the Church.</hi> Charles the Great calleth them Oblations. Theſe offeringes were after the Iewiſh manner, conſecrated by one, or moe prayers, which as yet are continued to bee read in diuerſe Lithurgies, and in the Romiſh Maſſe alſo, which (as we haue ſeen) are wreſted by a moſt pernicious para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, namelie, from the ſacrifice, which was giuen for a name to thoſe offeringes that were offered vnto God, to their pretended ſacrifice, which the Prieſt conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Ab oblatis inquam ad oblatam:</hi> and by conſequent, from a ſacrifice of fruites of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God by the people, to the ſacrifice of the Sonne of God our Lord, whome the Prieſt preſumeth to ſacrifice vnto him vppon this Altar. Wee neede not anie other proofe of this matter, then the prayers vſed in the Maſſe: <hi>Wee pray thee</hi> (ſayeth the Canon) <hi>that thou wilt accept of and bleſſe theſe giftes, theſe oblations and holy ſacrifices.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>We recommend vnto thee, thoſe who offer them vnto thee,</hi> or (as it is read at this day) <hi>For whome wee offer vnto thee, this ſacrifice of praiſe.</hi> Againe, <hi>That thou wouldest vouchſafe to regarde and looke downe vpon them with a milde and mercifull countenance, and accept of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thou vouchſafedſt to accept of the offerings of iuſt Abell, thy choſen childe, &amp;c.</hi> Again, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be laid vpon thine holie Altar, by the hands of thine Angell.</hi> For in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can all theſe prayers bee conceiued by any Chriſtian, for the ſacrifice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which their Prieſtes pretend to offer? For in them wee haue ſacrifices, alwaies in the plurall number, where it is neuer qualified or intituled by anie other name, then the ſacrifice of praiſe, where God ſhould be prayed vnto, to vouchſafe to looke downe vppon his welbeloued Sonne with a fauourable eye; being one with him, and hee in whome hee is well pleaſed? That hee would vouchſafe to accepte of him, as of the offeringes of iuſt Abell; of him, in whome alone all the Fathers haue beene accepted: without whoſe righteouſnes, the righteouſnes of Abell ſhoulde bee pollution and filthy vncleannes: to commaund that hee ſhould bee laide vpon the Altar by the handes of an Angell, being the eternall ſacrifice, the euerlaſting oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who found (as Iob ſayth,) vncleannes in the verie Angels. And indeed this is manifeſtly appearing in the Lithurgie,
<note place="margin">Liturg. Clem.</note> which they attribute vnto Clement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is an expreſſe praier, <hi>Pro dono oblato, for the oblation offered:</hi> but in theſe tearms, <hi>That it would pleaſe our good God to receiue it vpon his Altar, by the interceſſion of his Chriſt, for a ſmell of a ſweete ſauour, &amp;c.</hi> In other Greeke Lithurgies alſo, whoſe deſert we haue heretofore examined, wherin there are cleare and euident praiers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that is, for the oblations offered and brought;</hi> framed like vnto thoſe aboue, where they are called <hi>a ſpirituall ſacrifice of praiſe, offered without blood-ſhedde, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The name of Sacrifice now ſhufled and cloſely conueied into the Chriſtian Church, which at the firſt receiued the ſame from the Iewes, helped it not a little to paſſe from the action of thankeſgiuing, to a propitiatorie ſacrifice; and from an action of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, to a reall offering and oblation, being ioyned with that ignorance, which raigned after barbariſme in thoſe ages: as alſo with that, which was ordinary amongſt the people, and which in ſtead of being diſpelled, and driuen away by the bright light
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15548:136"/>of the Biſhoppes, was on the contrarie more ouercaſt and darkened. For it is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie acknowledged and confeſſed, as a thing moſt plaine and apparant in the ſight of ſuch as know anie thing in hiſtorie, that the Biſhoppes of that time, beſides the publike and ordinarie ignorance, were altogether giuen to the minding of worldlie matters, which the lawes of Charlemaine by name doe confirme and proue vnto vs: <hi>Let them abſtaine from worldly affaires, from the Court, from the warres, from hunting, hawking, playes, gaming, &amp;c.</hi> And hereto you may alſo adde the corruption of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which was in thoſe times by the mixture of many nations together: for of vulgar ones, they became meere barbarous, and of ſuch as were familiarlie ſpoken, ſuch as were not vnderſtoode: a great aide, oportunitie and aduantage for Sathan to ſowe his tares: for who woulde not otherwiſe haue reiected this realitie of the ſacrifice, when in euerie corner of the fielde, there was heard in their ſeruice, <hi>Surſum Corda,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>lift vp your heartes on hie:</hi> and when their currant ſpeech and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke was but of one Altar, and one celeſtiall ſacrifice: when in their entrance into the celebration of the ſacrament, it was ſaide vnto the people: <hi>Shew yee forth the death of the Son of man, and confeſſe his reſurrection, vntill his comming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there were two doctrines eſpeciallie, which ſpringing vppe in thoſe ages,
<note place="margin">Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and Purgatorie concuning and conſpiring together, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> and proſpering and growing together at that time, and that by equall degrees, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance and ſet aloft this pretended ſacrifice. The one, Tranſubſtantiation: for after ſuch time as it was taught that the bread and the wine were chaunged: that they were reallie the body and blood of our Lord; then what honour was too great to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſacrifice? Who can then doubt that it ſhould bee propitiatorie for the ſinnes of all that were liuing? this ſacrifice offered in the Maſſe, being the ſame in fleſh and blood, which was hanged vppon the Croſſe, for the ſinnes of the world? The other was that of Purgatorie: for if we haue (ſaide they) both our friendes departing &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of this worlde, to abide the ſcorching flames of Purgatorie, and that our owne ſinnes alſo muſt bee purged there, then let vs prouide a remedie, let vs goe to this Maſſe, which is ſo ſoueraigne and full of ſaluation, let vs laye good foundations, and powre out largelie for our ſelues and our parentes, let vs leaue grounds &amp; goods with charge of hauing the ſame ſaide after vs. And hereto belong the lawes aboue mentioned to bee made in the time of Charles the Great, and then euery day thinges grew from ill to worſe.</p>

For on the contrarie, to this error once ſo farre admitted of the multitude, there is added an other heape of more then good meaſure:
<note place="margin">Gab. Biel. lect. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is cleane an other thing to be preſent at the Maſſe, then to communicate in the holie ſupper: That the Maſſe,</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>by the worke wrought, that is to ſay, by being onely preſent, without receiuing anie thing, or yet bringing anie good motion thereunto, doth apply vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſuch perſon preſent al the merites of Chriſt.</hi> Who could not now loue the Maſſe better then the holie ſupper, which requireth a ſerious examination and tryall of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that offereth life, but repreſenteth to the vnworthie receiuer the dreadfull horror of tormenting hell? Againe, <hi>That the Maſſe hath a moſt speciall, a moſt great and an indefferent or middle power and efficacie: a moſt speciall in reſpect of the Prieſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by it hee meriteth eternall life: a moſt generall in respect of the Church, and all the members thereof, without anie exception: and a meane or middle, in respect of him or them that cauſe the ſame to bee ſaide, &amp;c.</hi> Of the ſacrament of the holie ſupper, the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sonne of God, of all the ſacramentes together, yea or of the verie death of Ieſus Chriſt: is there anie one of them, that hath written ſo high tearmes of commendation? But ſeeing that it hath ſuch efficacie and vertue in it, to what end is it ſo oft reiterated, or multiplied ſo manie waies, ſeeing that the oft adminiſtring and taking of a medicine, as they ſaye themſelues, is a marke and note of the weakenes of the ſame? But this queſtion is not yet throughlie decided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as thoſe that haue too eager a ſtomacke to looſe their fatte morſels. They dare not ſaye, that it is for anie wante of ſufficiencie in the ſacrifice: neither will they ſaye, that the vertue and efficacie thereof may bee ſo farre ſtretched and extended, as the ſufficiencie thereof woulde beare. Some ſaye that none but Ieſus Chriſt doth knowe, how farre it concerneth euerie man: Others that hee beſtoweth the power and vertue of the Maſſe, according to the determination and application of the Prieſt that ſacrificeth it.
<note place="margin">Gab.

Sometimes they ſay, that Chriſt hath offered his bodie vnto God in the ſupper, for the Apoſtles, and that in the Maſſe, the promiſes of the new Teſtament, euen thoſe of the remiſſion of ſins, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and that thereby it becommeth propitiatorie; yea, <hi>ex opere operato.</hi> Other ſometimes they ſay, that this ſacrifice doth not worke ſufficientlie and immediatelie,
<note place="margin">Bellarm. l. 2. de Miſſa. c. 4.2. Idem l. 1. c. 2.</note> and that it is not properlie ordained of God, the inſtrument to iuſtifie, as Baptiſme, and Abſolution are: but that it ſerueth onelie to obtaine the gifte of penance, by which the ſinner would drawe neare vnto the ſacrament, and bee iuſtified by it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſometime, that the Maſſe carrieth with it the remiſſion of ſinnes, in aſmuch as Chriſt hath ſacrificed his body and his blood for the remiſſion of the ſinnes of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and that in the ſame howre, wherein hee celebrated the ſupper with them,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15548:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>and commaunded them to continue the ſame, and therefore it is propitiatorie, yea, ſaith Caietanus, infinitelie meritorious and ſatiſfactorie. Sometimes they conclude, that to take it well and rightlie,
<note place="margin">Idem l. 2 de Miſla. c. 2. &amp; 4.</note> it is not ſo, but onely impetratorie; for, ſay they, Chriſt a mortall man, might merite and ſatisfie, and this is the cauſe why his ſacrifice is truly propitiatorie, aſwell as meritorious and ſatisfactorie; but Chriſt immortall, cannot anie more merite or ſatisfie: ſo neither can his ſacrifice be meritorious nor ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie, but onelie is called ſo, inaſmuch as hee obtaineth remiſſion for vs, whether it bee of the puniſhment or of the fault, or otherwiſe Grace to doe wel, and to merite &amp;c. and thereuppon wee ſaye: If that of Chriſtes in the ſupper bee propitiatorie, and yours but impetratorie, or auailable to obtaine fauour by intreatie, that then your ſacrifice is not the ſame with Chriſtes: but and if this bee that of Chriſtes, then you vtter open blaſphemie; becauſe you ſhould make that of Chriſtes not to bee propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorie.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this contrarietie is ſuted with an other: That the ſacrifice of the Croſſe is by conſequent, more excellent then that of the Maſſe, as ſayeth Vega, and Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine alſo;

Ieſus Chriſt, in reſpect of you, is hee not reallie ſacrificed in the one and in the other? and in that his bodie is glorified, ſhould that diminiſh and detract anie thing from the price and worth of this ſacrifice?
<note place="margin">Idem l. 2. c. 24. &amp; 27.</note> But here they are worſe intangled then before: for ſometimes Bellarmine ſaith: If there bee not in the Maſſe, a true and reall ſlaying of Chriſt, that then there is not a true and reall ſacrifice: for a true ſacrifice, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in killing, requireth of neceſſitie to haue it reall and indeede. Sometimes when this ſacrifice is offered of thinges without life, as breade and wine, there is no need of killing,
<note place="margin">Veg. Theſ. 12 l 8. De Miſſa</note> but onelie of eating, &amp;c. And of theſe contrary opinions, there do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo riſe contrary corollaries. Of ſome, as ſaith Vega, That Chriſt dieth myſtically, &amp; in figure vpon the Altar: but is offered vpon the ſame aliue: Of Others, That Chriſt is as truely ſlain and killed in the ſacrament of the Euchariſt, as he is truly exiſting &amp; being in the ſacrament, &amp; is offered in the ſame, either dead, or as it were dead.

<note place="margin">Gulielm. Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de Sacrif.

If the firſt be true, then the offering of the kinds, and the offering of the thing it ſelfe, are offered at ſeueral times, &amp; ſo the bond of relation is broken. If the ſecond, what followeth then, but that they ſacrifice nothing but bread and wine? For what other thing are they elſe according to their iudgement before the words of conſecration? Now of this contradiction followeth an other: Of ſome, which ſay, that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is properlie accompliſhed by the oblation;
<note place="margin">Vega. Theſ. 107. Turrian tract. 2. c. 22. Bellard. 1. de Miſſ. c. 27. Biel. lect. 81.</note> of others, by the eating of the ſame by the prieſt. And Vega and Bellarmine are at controuerſie one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To bee ſhorte, if they ſquare, and differ aboute the point, <hi>de opere operantis:</hi> neither can they better agree in that, <hi>de opere operato,</hi> by what meanes the benefite of this operation is applyed to thoſe that are preſent: whereas the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion adiudgeth according to Biel, that the onely being preſent at the conſecration
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15548:138"/>and oblation, maketh a man capable of ſaluation, without anie looking for of a ſpirituall life, as requiſite thereunto. And at the Councell of Trent, hee may ſeeme to holde on this ſide. The Cardinall Caietan on the contrarie,
<note place="margin">Anno 1518.</note> who did his endeuour at Auſbourg, to cauſe Luther to retract this propoſition: That faith was neceſſarie for the receiuing of the ſacrament, commeth ſo farre, namelie to ſay, That it is a common receiued error, that this ſactifice, <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caiet. in quod. libel. de vſu Spirit q. 3.</note> ſhould haue a certaine kinde of merite, or bee able to make application of ſome certaine kinde of ſatisfaction vnto this or that perſon, &amp;c. Doctrines as newlie come out of the minte, as the wordes themſelues, which are ſuch, as none of them that haue written twelue, yea thirteene hundred yeares after Chriſt, did euer heare of. And thus you ſee that theſe doe nothing at all agree together amongſt themſelues, howſoeuer they would make men belieue, that they are all as one, either in the matter, or in the forme of this pretended ſacrifice, neither yet aboute his effect or ende, no nor in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or circumſtances thereof. Wherefore how farre more commend able had it beene for them, and nearer to the purpoſe, to haue kepte themſelues to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, in the alone propitiatorie ſacrifice, accompliſhed on the Croſſe, for the declaration and remembrance, which is to be vſed, according to the inſtitution of the Lord in the holy ſupper.</p>
               <p>And furthermore it is certaine, that as by the grace of God, the light beganne to riſe and ſpring againe in the Church, notwithſtanding the terror and torment of the fire, which was kindled and blowne vppe againſt it in all nations: ſo the Doctors of Papiſtrie grewe aſhamed of this doctrine. Whereuppon wee ſee, that Sidonius, Faber, Zwifaltenſis and others, who writte in the time of Luther; did contente themſelues to call it the Sacrifice of remembrance: although vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe wordes they doe not laye out the efficacie thereof ſo fullie and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as they might. But beholde the Councell of Trent aſſembled and called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not to reforme the Church of Rome, as the Chriſtian Princes had hope they woulde: but rather to authorize and eſtabliſh, euen the moſt ill fauoured and deformed things that were therein, for ſo they prouided and brought to paſſe therein: <hi>If anie man holde and maintaine,</hi> (ſayeth it) <hi>that the Maſſe is not a true and proper ſacrifice: but rather a ſacrifice of repreſentation and praiſe, and not propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for the liuing and the deade: for ſinnes, puniſhmentes, ſatisfactions, and all other neceſſities, let him bee accurſed.</hi> Curſing thereby in a fewe wordes the whole Scripture, and all the olde Church. And Pope Pius the fourth, (in whoſe time it was helde) thruſt into the oath, which Biſhoppes were to take this Article, in expreſſe wordes: <hi>I belieue that there is offered vnto God in the Maſſe,
<note place="margin">Onuph. in vita Pii. 4.</note> a true, proper, and propitiatorie Sacrifice, for the quick and the dead, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But what? And is there ſuch abhomination in the Maſſe? Let vs make a plaine and ſimple rehearſall of the principall errors therein, without anie making of them more heinous and grieuous, then they are indeede. The firſt, This pretended Sacrifice hath no inſtitution or warrant in the worde of God: but hath it on the contrarie, directlie againſt it. What audacious boldenes was this in man, to dare to inuent of his owne braine a ſacrifice by which God might bee appeaſed and made at one with vs? And what other thing is it but an <gap reason="foreign">

What is this then but to aboliſh the holie Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lorde, vnder the colour of offering of it? And who is hee that will

And againe, what preſumption, to dare thus to tranſforme the Will and Teſtament of the Sonne of God, made and ſet downe in his holie Supper: a thing not to bee endured in the Will and Teſtament of anie meane or baſe perſon? The thirde, The Maſſe is derogatorie to the onelie Sacrifice of the Sonne of God, made vppon the Croſſe, and that not onelie by putting it ſelfe in place thereof, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by aduancing, and ſetting forth of the power and efficacie thereof farre aboue the other. It is ſaide, <hi>There is but one oblation:</hi> the Sonne of God giuen for the ſinnes of the worlde: this oblation the Maſſe will needes bee, and yet renued and reiterated euerie howre. <hi>Whereas there is pardon and remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>there is no more anie oblation to bee offered.</hi> And what ſhould followe of this continuall and ordinarie repeating of this Sacrifice,, but that as yet there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? And that the ſacrifice of Chriſt, is either vnprofitable or imperfect? And who doubteth but that this is the ſame which the Apoſtle called the fruſtrating and making of the Croſſe of Chriſt of no effect? and what more woulde hee haue made of it, if hee had hearde the reſt of their blaſphemies: as that the ſacrifice of the Croſſe hath not purged and done awaye anie but originall ſinne: but that the Maſſe hath taken awaye actuall ſinnes, &amp;c. and by conſequent to become fellowe-worker with the ſame. What can this bee tearmed but to declare the Sacrifice of Chriſt inſufficient, to renounce the power, as alſo the benefite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both together? The fourth, The Maſſe taketh awaye aſmuch as lyeth in it, the onelie Prieſthoode of Ieſus Chriſt, whereof no other creature is capable: for ſeeing it was requiſite that the Prieſt ſhoulde bee eternall, and the ſacrifice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; followeth it not that one and the ſame was to bee both the Prieſt and the Sacrifice? And what other then but the Sonne of God, offering vppe himſelfe once to God by the holie Ghoſt: and alwaies by his infinite merite, making interceſſion for the infinite multitude of our ſinnes, vnto the infinite iuſtice and mercie of God? And what a blaſphemie is it then to ſay, that anie man, yea or that anie creature is able to performe the ſame? And theſe are the abhominations which wee finde in the Maſſe, as they make it the pretended ſacrifice of the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, propitiatorie for the quicke and the deade: for ſuch a one our aduerſaries doe teach it to bee: the reſt riſing of the deprauing and corrupte wreſting of the ſacrament ſhall bee ſpoken of hereafter. And now wee are to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the finding out of the originall, and firſt beginning, as alſo of the growth and proceeding of this applying of the benefite thereof to the deade, deriued and fetcht, as one error from an other, from the opinion or rather imagination of Purgatorie.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15548:139"/>is no other helpe, but that which may bee procured and ſupplied by a number of Maſſes. Surelie man was a ſinner and mortall from the beginning of the world, yea, man I ſay, was ſubiect to dye in ſinne, being indebted by ſinne, and by conſequent to incurre this penaltie of Purgatorie: God likewiſe from all eternitie, both iuſt &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, iuſt in hauing appointed this puniſhment for ſinne from the firſt creation of mankinde: and mercifull, as hauing taught him from the beginning, the meanes of mitigating and remedying the ſame. Which doctrine proueth Purgatorie to bee no newe fiction (if ſo bee it may haue place,) but to haue beene euer ſince the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde. Now if it bee of this antiquitie, then it will bee found mentioned &amp; ſpoken of; and that in plaine tearmes in the olde church: and the remedie alſo of this fire, cannot but bee reuealed by God, and practiſed amongſt his people. And ſo much the more, in that the mercifulnes of God in Ieſus Chriſt, leſſe ſhining in the firſt times and ages of the worlde (the onelie ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, being couered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vailes of the law,) made by all likelyhoode, the remedy of Purgatory to be the more haunted and practiſed vnder the olde Teſtament, as being at that time moſt needfull and neceſſarie. Heere our aduerſaries make vs this anſwere: whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it then, that in all the writinges of Moſes and the Prophetes, there is nothing ſpoken of it? that amongſt ſo manie threatninges, which are made againſt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the law, this ſhould not bee ſo much as once touched? That amongſt ſo manie ſacrifices ordained for voluntarie, and willinglie committed ſinnes, as alſo for ſinnes committed vnwillingly, and of ignorance: as likewiſe, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of ſo manie expiatorie, and purging ſacrifices, for all manner of pollutions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came of ſicknes, infirmitie, ſinne, or of the defiling comming by touching of the dead, &amp;c. there ſhould not bee found anie thing appointed for ſinnes after death, not anie ſacrifice, not anie offering? And yet notwithſtanding they died euery daye: and how deepelie engaged in ſinne? There is likewiſe nothing founde to bee practiſed in the Church, in the behalfe of the dead, whereuppon a man hath not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground either from literall or figuratiue interpretation, to proue this Purgatorie. The Patriarkes did burie their wiues and children: they were carefull of buying ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, of mourning, and of conueying of their bones from one place to an other. Where was their pietie (if it may bee tearmed pietie) to pray for the deade? Dauid wept for Ionathan, his verie true and truſtie friende: and Salomon for Dauid his predeceſſor and Father. If theſe did practiſe no ſuch thing, what may wee coniecture thereof more? But and if they did practiſe ſuch a thing, then whereby ſhall it become apparant vnto vs by anie one worde? And that notwithſtanding, that Dauid haue made ſo manie prayers vppon ſo many occaſions, and thoſe both of ioye and alſo of mourning; and ſo manie kinges of Iſraell and Iuda, haue beene honourably buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as alſo ſo manie Prophetes left vnto vs behinde them, their open proteſtations againſt impieties and vngodlines, and in the commendation of pietie and godlines, euerie one in his time: none of them reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending this deuotion vnto vs for pietie, or accuſing of impietie thoſe that haue omitted and neglected it, yea no one of them authoriſing the ſame, either by precept or example? And it auaileth not to ſay, That there was not in the Church of the Iewes any ſacrifice for the deade, becauſe that (according to the doctrine of the Church of Rome) Paradice was not opened to the Fathers, vnto the death of our Lord. For woulde not this haue beene a refreſhment and comforte vnto them, to haue beene tranſlated from Purgatorie, into the limbes: from a place of dolour and paine, and that ſuch as they deſcribe it to bee, into a place of reſt? And againe, what apparance is there, that they ſhoulde haue remained there without remedie, for the ſpace of ſome three or foure thouſande yeares? what inequalitie had there beene in ſuch puniſhment, in reſpect of that which is inflicted at this daye, when as they come forth now from day to daye, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee through the abſolute authoritie of the Pope, by his Indulgences, or by the diligence of their kinſfolkes, not neglecting to contribute and beſtowe theſe ſuffrages vppon them? In concluſion if there bee anie ſuch thing, it is as old as the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15548:140"/>creation, and that more clearelie appearing vnder the olde Teſtament, then vnder the newe: and if it bee vnder the olde, then it ought to haue had ſacrifices for the deade: and that a great deale more requiſite at that time, then vnder the new: but and if the lawe had no ſuch ſacrifices, neither then was there (as it followeth by conſequent) anie Purgatorie; neither indeede is there at this daye. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs ſee if the olde Teſtament ſay anie thing of it, yea if it ſpeake of it in plaine tearmes, as the importance of the thing doth require: if (I ſay) in ſuch ſorte, as it is ſaide to agree and ſtand with the iuſtice and mercie of God, the inſtruction of the Church, and the reſt and conſolation of poore diſtreſſed ſoules.</p>
               <p>Now it is moſt certaine,
<note place="margin">That Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cannot bee found in the olde Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Deutr. 30.

And theruppon it is, that without leauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing coniecturall vnto vs betwixt thoſe two, the Prophete ſayeth: <hi>The iuſt man dyeth, and departeth hence in peace, lying himſelfe down to reſt in his bed.</hi> In peace, that is to ſaye, to ſpeake after the manner of the Hebrewes, in all proſperitie, verie farre from the pretended horrible paines of Purgatorie. But yet let vs heare them ſpeake, to ſee what they can alleadge, and let vs withall beare it continuallie in minde, that our aduerſaries doe make it an Article of their faith: and ſo by conſequent the lawe of the auncient Fathers ought here to take place: as that of Saint Ierome: <hi>That vpon obſcure, doubtfull, darke, and allegoricall places of the Scripture, wee ought not to grounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie pointe of doctrine.</hi> That of Saint Auguſtine; <hi>That in the controuerſie of religion, darke and figuratiue places muſt bee ſet aſide, and thoſe onelie helde, which are cleare of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:</hi> And that of the Schoolemen likewiſe: <hi>That allegoricall Diuinitie doth not proue, &amp;c.</hi>

But the point is, that they haue neither Greeke, nor Hebrew Paraphraſt, neither Iewiſh, nor yet Chriſtian Commentarie, which euer could finde out Purgatorie by this text. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, who hath made an expreſſe Homily vpon this verſe, notwithſtanding he be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie delighted in allegorizing,
<note place="margin">Orig. hom. 9. in Leuit. Ieronym in Ezech. c. 49.47. Theod. in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. c. 12.</note> could not perceiue anie ſuch matter therein.

Sophronius Biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople proueth the greatneſſe of our redeemer, who hath turned the curſe by Adam into a bleſſing, his death into life, and his fall into a riſing againe. But S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſtandeth more amply vpon it, and in better ſort, ſaying: <hi>The Lord killeth and quickneth againe, &amp;c. and this is nothing els but that which he repeateth againe when he ſaith: He bringeth to the gates of hell, and bringeth backe againe: He killeth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to that which the Apoſtle ſaith: If you be dead with Chriſt, ſeeke the things which are aboue, &amp;c. For you are dead, &amp;c. And afterward he addeth: And our life is hid with Chriſt: behold how he killeth them holeſomely: behold how he reuiueth and quickneth them againe. But hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them likewiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to hell, and bringeth them backe againe. Without doubt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this was accompliſhed in our head, in whom our life is hid. For he that hath not spared his owne Sonne, hath ſlaine him for vs: and in that he hath raiſed him vp againe, he hath alſo quickened him, brought him to hell, and backe againe, according to that which hath beene ſaid: Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell: and of his pouertie we are made rich, &amp;c.</hi> By their accompt it ſhould follow, holding the expoſition of Saint Auguſtine, that our Lord had beene in purgatorie.

For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God to bring downe to the gates of hell, that is to ſtrike amaſed the hartes of ſinners with the apprehenſion of eternall torments, and to bring them backe from thence, that is, to relieue their aſtoniſhed hearts, ſorrowing and bewailing their faultes by the hope of eternall life, &amp;c.</hi> And yet euerie one knoweth if hee fauour purgatorie or no. Hugo the Cardinall: <hi>This is a metaphoricall ſpeech; He bringeth Phenenna, euen into extreame affliction, taking her children from her: hee bringeth againe Hanna, making her fruitfull when ſhe was barren.

For from the creation, vnto the time of Hanna, there was not any that riſe out of hell, none that riſe againe from the dead: but God hath often cauſed many free and innocent perſons to be put in priſon, and hath brought many out from thence againe.</hi>

               <p>In the laſt of the firſt of Samuel, it is ſaid: That the valiant men of Iſrael,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. the laſt Chapt. ver. the laſt. 2. Sam. 1.12.</note> after the ouerthrow of Saule, did burie the bodie of Saule, and of his children, burned them in Iabes, tooke their bones &amp; buried them, and faſted ſeuen daies. And in the 2. Sam. 1.12. that Dauid mourned, wept and faſted. And thereupon Bellarmine reaſoneth
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15548:141"/>thus: He faſted, therefore he prayed: therefore he belieued there was a purgatorie. Whereas he ſhould rather reaſon to the contrarie: for that the prophet in the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of ſo many circumſtances, of burnt bodies, of bones gathered together and buried, of weeping, mourning, faſting, &amp;c. doth to the wondring of men, ſay neuer a word of this pretended praier, which yet had beene the principall and ſubſtance. His cloake to couer the matter withall,
<note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> is for that in another place it is ſaid, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid faſted and praied for the ſonne, which he had by Berſheba. Then let him call to mind withall, how that after the child was once dead, he ceaſed both to faſt, and alſo by conſequent to pray for him. But the hiſtorie is cleare of it ſelfe: Namely, that Dauid &amp; the people acknowledging in this ouerthrow the wrath of God vpon Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, they humbled themſelues before him, as may plainly bee read in the wordes as they are there expreſly ſet downe. <hi>They faſted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe of Saule and Ionathan his ſonne, and of the Lords people, &amp; of the houſe of Iſrael, becauſe they had fallen by the ſword.</hi> And further then thus Ioſephus obſerueth not any thing in this ſtorie, ſaue that wee haue alſo to note therein the whole complaint and mone that Dauid made for the death of Saule and Ionathan, in moſt lamentable ſpeeches, but yet ſuch, as whereout there cannot any tittle of praier for the dead bee gathered, neither yet any thing for purgatorie.</p>

                  <hi>And the furie and fierce wrath of the Lord, continued to waxe hot against the houſe of Iſrael: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dauid was moued to ſay vnto Ioab: go and number Iſrael and Iuda, &amp;c.</hi> reprouing Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodorus: who of the litterall ſence reſting in Dauid, made an allegoricall, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to Iob: as if this Pſalme had beene made by Dauid, for to repreſent and ſet out the affliction of Iob, and not becauſe of the remorce and ſence of his owne tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cleane contrarie to the opinion &amp; iudgement of all the old writers, either Iewes or Chriſtians.

<note place="margin">Orig. hom. 11, in pſal. 38.</note> And yet notwithſtanding they make Origen their buckler in this conflict, whome all old writers haue condemned, for turning the ſcriptures from their naturall ſence by his allegories.

Let them reade that which goeth before, and that which followeth, they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the prophet ſpeaketh of the deſolation of Ieruſalem, and of the reſtoring of the ſame in Ieſus Chriſt.

And the Gloſſe: <hi>In the spirit of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the lighteſt and leaſt ſinnes, and in the ſpirit of zeale, the more grieuous, both the one and the other by pennance.</hi> Now the truth is cleare, how that purgatorie is not pennance, as alſo, that it is not ordained for ſinnes, but for puniſhment: but and if it be, as ſome would haue it, for ſinnes, yet it is but for pettie and ſleight ſinnes. Ireneus ſaith, <hi>It is the word alone that waſheth away the filthines of the daughters of Sion, that waſhed the feete of his diſciples, and which ſanctifieth their whole bodies.</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus: <hi>It is the good spirituall waſhing which cleanſeth the ſoule,

And alſo in the spirit of zeale, by the grace of baptiſme, which is not begotten in vs without the ſpirit, &amp;c. For we are not baptiſed with bare water, but with the holy Ghoſt, with this diuine and intellectuall fire, which waſteth in vs the vncleanneſſe of our vicious nature, and melteth and burneth all the spots of ſinne,
<note place="margin">Haimo ibid.</note> &amp;c.</hi> Haimo: <hi>The ſame holy Ghoſt is called the spirit of iudgement, and the spirit of zeale and feruencie: of iudgement, becauſe that in baptiſme Sathan is iudged, and as it were condemned, when his power ouer man is taken away from him: of zeale, becauſe he inflameth the heartes of men with loue towardes their creator, ſcouring away the canker of ſin, whereof it is ſaid, God is a conſuming fire, he will baptiſe vs with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, &amp;c.</hi> And Hugo the Cardinall in like manner. And thus you may ſee by theſe ancient fathers, how they haue made a purgatorie of the holy Ghoſt, and of the temptations and trials happening in this life, the paines of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie which cannot be, except in the other. And Lyranus: <hi>In the spirit of iudgement; for our Lord hath ſatiſfied for the Church by the way of iustice: in the spirit of zeale, becauſe he hath performed it in a great meaſure of charitie and loue.</hi> And yet this is one of the textes whereby Bellarmine laboureth to make his cauſe ſo ſtrong. And here we are not to forget his vnſound and vnfaithfull dealing: for that which S.

               <p>As colde is that which followeth, Eſay 54. <hi>I haue hidde my fauour and my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from thee for a while, in the moment of mine indignation: But I haue had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of thee in euerlaſting mercy.</hi> Here God ſpeaketh vnto the Church, as vnto his ſpouſe, reiected and forſaken for her ſinnes, in his iuſt diſpleaſure, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againe into grace in his mercie.

And myſtically, for a little, that is in respect of the temptations of this worlde, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in respect of the glorie to come.

<note place="margin">Hieronym in Eſa. c 54. Cyrill. l. 5. orat. 2. in Eſa. Haim. in Eſa. c. 54.</note> Saint Ierome interpreteth it of the multiplying of the Church by the calling of the Gentiles. Saint Cyrill of the Gentilles forſaken for a little, but eſpouſed for euer, &amp;c. Haimo vppon Eſay taketh it in the ſame ſence. Which ſaying S. Ierome layeth in ballance to weigh againſt the Iewes, who would haue this propheſie to belong to themſelues alone. But of all theſe there is not one that hath taken the ſmalleſt or leaſt ſent of Purgatorie from this place.</p>
               <p>Ieremie the firſt: <hi>What ſeeſt thou Ieremie? J ſee a potte boyling, and the forepart thereof is towarde the North.</hi>

And when as the Church hath not touched or had any dealing with the reportes and narrations contained in the ſecond booke; partly, as not agreeing vppon the ſame matters with that of the firſt, and partly for their being detected and conuinced of falſhood, by the whole ſtorie of the ancient geſtes of the Iewes: as in that matter of the hidden fire of the Arke, &amp;c. which Nehemiah and Eſdras would not haue concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp;c.

               <p>In the ſecond book it is certaine, that from the time of the Machabees,
<note place="margin">2. Machab. 4.7.12.</note> the Iewes by means of the familiaritie that they had with the Grecians, began mightily to incline to Paganiſme.

<note place="margin">2.

There the firſt booke ſtayeth without ſpeaking of any ſacrifice or praier for the deade. The ſecond book goeth further: Iuda ſaith it, hauing beaten Gorgias, came to carry away the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <gap reason="foreign">

Hitherto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, Ioſua 7. Deuteronomie, 21. That which followeth goeth further: that is, that it pretendeth alſo, that the oblation of theſe groates did ſerue for the purging away and blotting out of the prouocation of that ſinne committed by the dead. But now we are to ſee how farre this may make for purgatorie. It appeareth that Iuda ought not to belieue or doe this, either by reaſon of the law, or in reſpect of any example of the fathers, or yet by reaſon of any cuſtome receiued in the church: for it is not ſpoken of in all the ſcripture. And in deed, the Author himſelfe giuing his iudgement theron, ſheweth ſufficiently, that he doth it by way of a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>dealing verie honeſtly and ciuillie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in diſcourſing vppon the reſurrection.</hi> And it is likewiſe as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that it was not in any conſideration of Purgatorie: <hi>but rather</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the laſt reſurrection.</hi> In ſo much as that the intention and drift of this prayer properly was, that this ſinne might not be imputed vnto them in the day of the iudgement of the Lord, which ſhall bee at the generall reſurrection: a praier which conueieth not either good or euil vnto the dead: no more then that of Paul for Oneſiphorus, when hee was aliue:
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. Ingolſtadien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord giue him to find mercie with the Lord in that day.</hi> For as for that which certaine Ieſuites ſay, that hee ſpeaketh of the myſticall reſurrection from ſinne and not of the actuall, there needes no more but the reading of the text to refute them. It appeareth likewiſe by our aduerſaries their doctrine, that this praier and ſacrifice could not be, to draw them out of Purgatory. For the ſinne according to their owne diſtinction was mortall, being idolatrie, which is treaſon againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God, &amp; that in the higheſt degree. Now purgatorie is not for mortall ſinnes. Againe, God ſay they, doth neuer puniſh one and the ſame thing twiſe. But it was ſaith the Author, for this ſinne that they had beene ſlaine, and that euerie man did iudge it ſo: wherefore they were not to haue inflicted vpon them any more tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhment, that is to ſay, any purgatorie. Againe, purgatorie, ſay they, doth not ſatiſfie for the fault, but for the puniſhment: and notwithſtanding Iudas doeth there offer a ſacrifice for ſinne, which was neuer offred in the law, for the puniſhment onely, but for the fault: wherefore it followeth, that in that his action hee had no mind of purgatory, ſo much as to thinke once thereof, ſo farre was he from the thing. For the Author addeth: <hi>He conſidered that thoſe which were dead in a true godly ſort, could not faile to find grace and fauour: which is</hi> ſaith he (by a parentheſis) <hi>a ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thought.</hi> And ſo it is in the Greeke text, far differing from that which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: namely, that all leſſe or more, may bee ſuppoſed to ſtand in need to bee freed from purgatorie. But ſay they, yet he praid for the dead: let it be ſo. How beit we ſhal ſee by and by, that it is but an euill argument to go about to proue purgatory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſuch praiers. And on the contrary we haue reaſon to belieue, ſeeing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the Church of Rome it ſelfe, this place cannot ſtand with purgatory, that this ſacrifice hath no other end, as may appeare by the text, but to pray vnto God, that in the laſt reſurrection he wold be fauorable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But there is more in the matter: Iudas did it, ſay they, therefore it is wel done. That we deny. How many actions do we reade of in the ſcriptures of famous men, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are not to be imitated? In the church of God, men liue by his lawes, &amp; not by our owne examples: neither do we ſee in deed, ſince the time of the Machabees, vnto the comming of Chriſt, that this example was euer followed in the Church. The mourning alſo and lamentation made for Lazarus is contrarie hereunto.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> And
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15548:146"/>as concerning that the author of this booke doth approue it, ſo hee did the fact of Razias, who murthered himſelfe. And this is the cauſe why S. Auguſtine ſayeth to the Donatiſtes, which woulde haue made it a good conſequent: <hi>That theſe bookes ought to be read ſoberlie:</hi> and the ſame libertie haue wee to aunſwere our aduerſaries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame ſort, in a different and diuerſe cauſe, but about the ſame author. To bee ſhort, this ſeconde booke of the Machabees doth approue prayer for the dead: but to bring them to bee allowed by the Church it is requiſite, that they ſhould firſt bee allowed of by the word: and all this notwithſtanding, as wee haue ſeene, doth not make any thing for Purgatorie. Inſomuch as that of ſo manie textes, alleadged out of the olde Teſtament, wee haue ſeene them by the confeſſion of Perion, to haue not ſo much as one left them beſides this ſame, as being put beſides all holde and proofe in the Canonicall, and tyed to one onelie Apocrypha text; and that ſuch a one as is the moſt Apocrypha of all the reſt: and yet euen that cannot ſtand &amp; match with Purgatorie. Whereupon wee conclude here: That Purgatorie hath not anie one foundation or ground in all the olde Teſtament, not anie one in all the Church of Iſrael, where notwithſtanding, it ſeemed to haue beene moſt neceſſarie and requiſite. Wherefore there is no cauſe why we ſhould meruaile, if manie of the Church of Rome haue liked it better to ſay and hold: <hi>That there was no Purgatorie in the time of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Church.</hi>

               <p>In S. Mathew, 3. S. Iohn Baptiſt ſayeth:

                  <hi>I baptize you with water vnto amendement of life, but hee that commeth after mee, is ſtronger then I, &amp;c. Hee ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire. Hee hath his fanne in his hand, and will make cleane his floore, and gather his corne into his garner: but hee will burne the chaffe with vnquenchable fire.</hi> Of theſe two fires mentioned in this place: which of them will they chuſe to make a Purgatorie of?

But our Lord without our further ſeeking of any other expounder, maketh it cleare inough elſewhere, ſaying, <hi>Iohn hath baptized you with water: but you ſhall bee baptized with the holie Ghoſt within theſe few dayes.</hi> And beholde the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof in the Actes, 2.

But and if we muſt needes fall to allegorize, yet let vs learne to do it, as our Lord himſelfe, who ſaith: <hi>If you forgiue not men their ſinnes, your father will not forgiue you yours.</hi> But on the contrarie hee will handle you like to him in the parable, whome he deliuered to the executioners, vntill ſuch time as hee had paide the whole debt; that is to ſay, for euer: for he had vtterly diſabled himſelfe before, for paying of it.

The ſence of the text is cleare, that our Lord, (to correct the falſe gloſes of the Scribes, who bounded the breach of the Law, within the compaſſe of outward actions) doth labour throughout the whole Chapter to bring them backe to the inward motions and affections, ſhewing vnto them, that the faults which they iudged ſleight, as to be angrie with their brother; to giue croſſe and reproachfull ſpeeches, &amp;c. doe come

And againe their Purgatorie is a place of executing of a iudgement or ſentence; but in theſe ſpeeches is contained nothing but the iudgement or ſentence? Againe, Purgatorie is but one place, and here be two named: So that we are firſt to know of them, which they will chuſe, and then what they will vnderſtand by the other? But S.

Lyranus alſo, who would moralize the ſame, ſaith: <hi>Our Lord made here three degrees of anger in the heart: Whoſoeuer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is angrie: and a two-fold in the mouth, when it proceedeth to a confuſed and ouer whelmed plight in offering of iniuries; ſuch as men are in when they fal to rayling and calling of their brother Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha: or elſe, in a formall iniurie, as he that ſaith vnto him, foole, &amp;c. and theſe three degrees haue their puniſhments: Iudgement, when men are conuented before the ſeate of iudgement: A Councell, when it commeth to many mens voices, to determine and giue ſentence, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Gloſe ſaith: <hi>Reus eſt iudicio,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Dignus accuſatione,</hi> worthie to be accuſed: <hi>Reus conſilio,</hi> that is to ſay, worthie to haue ſentence pronounced againſt him by the generall conſent of the Iudges, <hi>Dignus conſenſu iudicum, de danda ſententia in eum, &amp;c.</hi> And Caietan commeth verie neere vnto the ſame. But what maketh all this for Purgatorie? Yea which is more, though ſome haue vnderſtood it of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after this life, as Auguſtine; yet neuer any man of Purgatorie.</p>
               <p>In S.
<note place="margin">Math. 12.31.</note> Mathew 12. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall haue ſpoken againſt the holy Ghost, it ſhall not bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, either in this world or in the world to come.</hi> Then there are ſinnes which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in the other world: and therefore this is in Purgatorie, &amp;c. This text cannot be better vnderſtood, then by the other Euangeliſts, and by S. Mathew himſelfe. Saint Marke ſaith: <hi>He ſhall neuer be forgiuen.</hi> Whereupon S. Auguſtine ſaith: <hi>Saint Marke hath ſaid the ſame in other words:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 3.28. Luk. 12.10.</note> S. Luke. <hi>It ſhall not bee forgiuen him:</hi> S. Mathew in the verſe going before, <hi>It ſhall not be forgiuen.</hi> And if any man bee deſirous or inquiſitiue, yet to know ſome further meaning then this: Not in this world; where God iudgeth the ſinnes of his Church, by the miniſterie and order eſtabliſhed in the ſame: nor in the world to come, when as hee will ſit himſelfe in perſon to iudge them: and this is all, that can rightly be drawne out of this place. And indeed the old writers are of one accord,
<note place="margin">Damaſc. de Orthod. fid. li. 2. ca. 1.</note> holding that theſe words, <hi>The world to come,</hi> doe either ſignifie euerlaſting puniſhment or euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe, and muſt bee taken and vnderſtoode of that which followeth after the reſurrection and not before. Afterward they offend againſt their owne generall rules: for their Schoolemen ſay, that there is no forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, but in this world; how ſo euer ſatisfaction for ſin is made, according to their doctrine, in the world to come. But the queſtion here, is of the remiſsion of ſinnes, and not of their temporall puniſhment. And it is not to be ſtoode vppon or ſaid, that ſmall and veniall ſinnes are forgiuen there: for the compariſon is made here of the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, with other the moſt grieuous ſinnes that are. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how can that proue a good reaſon or Argument, which is taken from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular negatiue, to an vniuerſall affirmatiue? The ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is not forgiuen in this world, nor in that to come: therefore the temporall puniſhments of all manner of ſinnes not paid and diſcharged here, ſhall bee exacted and paid in the world to come,

But it is certaine that the old writers did not vnderſtand this place thus. S. Athanaſius hath made a ſpeciall treatiſe vpon this verſe, and made no mention of Purgatorie. And S. Ierome, and S.

And alſo it hath alwaies beene taken and expounded for Hell by all the old writers. But yet they fall to worke vpon the words contained in the ſame Chapter:
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Make you friends of the vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Mammon, to the end that when you ſhallwant, they may receiue you into euerlaſting ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles.</hi> In ſo much as that here Bellarmine, taketh vppon him to crie victorie on their ſide, becauſe that Peter Martyr hath paſt this place without anſwere. Our Lord warneth vs, by the example of the vniuſt Steward, to make vs friends of our riches, to the end, that as hee did make him friends, that did receiue him when he was out of office and credite, ſo likewiſe we ſhould doe the ſame by our Almes, that ſo when we ſhall be called from our ſtewardſhip (for wee are no better then Stewards) they may receiue vs into euerlaſting Tabernacles. And this is according to that which is ſaid in an other place: That euen a cup of cold water giuen in the name of Chriſt, is not without his reward. Theſe friends, they are the poore, but together therewithall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous: Theſe Tabernacles are eternall life: Theſe friends, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe vnderſtand, that they are to die before vs; and there is not any one of the Fathers, that haue expounded it otherwiſe, this is verie farre from ſtaying behind, to helpe vs with their ſuffrages.

               <p>Now we cannot better come out of this Labyrinth, then by the courſe of the text. Saint Paul therefore hauing ſpoken before, of the Doctors and Paſtors that doe teach in the Church, and continuing his diſcourſe ſaith: That the foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is Chriſt, that is to ſay, the remiſsion and forgiueneſſe of ſinne in him: That if thoſe Doctors and Paſtors doe build vppon this foundation, matter conformable and correſpondent vnto the ſame, that is to ſay, ſound and ſincere doctrines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, that then when they come to triall, they will be able to beare out and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the ſame: whereas on the contrarie, vaine and friuolous doctrines, will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and turne to nothing as dooth the ſmoake in the ayre. The ſound and ſincere ones he compareth to Gold, Siluer, and precious ſtones, matters able to indure the fire: but the corrupt and vaine ones, to wood, haye, or ſtraw, all of them being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which doe not beare or indure the fire, yea which on the contrarie, doe ſerue for nothing more then to ſet it on flame and kindle it.

For why ſhall it in that place ſignifie vnto Bellarmine, the ſeuere iudgement of God, examining and making triall of workes and doctrines, and in this place, a materiall fire of Purgatorie, which burneth not workes or doctrines, whereof the queſtion is, but the ſoules of men? And in deed S. Auguſtine and S. Gregorie haue taken both theſe two fires for one; that is to ſay, tribulations: Chryſoſtome and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact for one; that is, the euerlaſting fire: and many of the late writers, for one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Purgatorie. The diſtinction came not to be knowne, vntill ſuch time as it was eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the former word could not bee auouched in this ſignification, and therefore they haue reſtrained it to this latter. Now we ſay that this commeth to paſſe in many good Doctors and Teachers, who haue built and brocht many friuolous doctrines of a good intention, vpon this foundation of Chriſtian faith, and ceaſe not, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be happie by the mercies of God, becauſe they haue retained and held it faſt, eſpecially at the time of the approaching of the pangs of their death: as is recorded of many in writing, and which doe now ioy and reioyce in heauen, to ſee them burnt, and deuoured, yea euen this pretended fire alſo, by the effectuall power of the word of God, whome they ſee and well perceiue to bee glorified, in the deſtruction of their workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:15548:151"/>
Now whoſoeuer he is that ſhall reade this text without preiudice, wil eaſily reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this interpretation. And in deed that of Bellarmines (for it doth not agree with any of the old writers) cannot free it ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many inconueniences. We are very neere at agreement with him, concerning that which is to be vnderſtood by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, builders, and that which is diuerſly built thereupon. But we ſtill differ &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree about the day of fire which trieth and proueth the doctrines, nor yet vpon the fire, from which the Teachers doe eſcape and ſaue themſelues: hee confuteth the opinion of Caietanus, who vnderſtandeth it to be the day of euerie particular mans iudgement, that is to ſay, his laſt day, or deathes day: And for mine owne part I agree with him therein, as holding it abſurd, without bringing any further witneſſe for the ſame. But hee would vnderſtand by the ſame the latter iudgement, preſuppoſing ſtill, that it is <hi>that day of the Lord.</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that day</hi> ſimply. He ſaith alſo, that in that day it ſhall bee manifeſted, which ſide hath the truth, by the proofe and tryall which ſhal be made; and that before ſuch, as it concerneth to know the ſame. This then ſhall be in this preſent life, as S. Auguſtine, and S. Gregorie doe vnderſtand it. Thus far we both are agreed vppon the fire which proueth the doctrines; namely, that it is not any materiall fire, (contrarie to that which they affirme, that would haue it the fire of Purgatorie;) but the effectuall working of the Iuſtice and ſeueritie of God, in the day of iudgement: whereas we vnderſtand it with S. Ambroſe, of the word of God, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his holy ſpirit, exerciſing his authoritie &amp; power in the Church: And this we hold to be ſo much the more agreable, becauſe the triall is by nature to go before the ſentence of iudgement; as alſo for that this triall is made for the inſtruction of the Church, by manifeſting and making knowne, on what ſide the truth ſtandeth: and therefore in this life, and therefore alſo before the iudgment. But neuertheleſſe, Bellarmine in all this portion of Scripture hitherto hath not found out Purgatorie. About the fire from which the Teachers do ſaue themſelues, we doe eſpecially ſquare and diſagree, for therein he findeth his Purgatorie, but we ſay vnto him, that there is no apparance that from one verſe to an other, this fire ſhould ſuffer ſuch an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and chaunge in his nature, as of a ſpirituall, to become materiall, and of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke of the iudgement of God, to become a reall and ſubſtantiall flame. That theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doe note out vnto vs a meere metaphoricall fire. That ſeeing as he himſelfe ſaith, the queſtion here is of the day of iudgement; that therefore here is no more to doe with Purgatorie: that ſeeing the fire of iudgement hath alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and eaten vp the wood, haye, and ſtrawe, that there is not left behind any manner of thing to be burned in this; no not the Author himſelfe, ſeeing that hee muſt by this iudgement, goe preſently to life or to death eternall. For as concerning that Bellarmine ſaith; he ſhall be ſaued, but ſo as it were by fire, that is to ſay, he ſhall be ſaued, prouided alwaies that he muſt firſt haue paſſed and gone through the fire: This is the begging of the matter in queſtion, and this is to ſet downe for graunted, the thing that is in controuerſie.</p>
               <p>In the end he commeth to ſeeke his defence from the old writers: who how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie they are one to an other, wee haue alreadie ſeene, and it will not ſtand him in any ſeruice. Chryſoſtome vnderſtandeth by this latter fire, the eternall fire; and to be ſaued, to be as much as not to be conſumed in the ſaid fire. Saint Auguſtine and Saint Gregorie, the tribulations of this life. Theodoret and Oecumenius, they ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the vniuerſall world on fire, which ſhall be accompliſhed in the day of the laſt iudgement. And as concerning the place which Saint Thomas alleadgeth out of Theodoret vpon this Epiſtle, it is not to bee found either in the Greeke or Latine Copie: but hee affirmeth verie well, that the Teacher ſhall bee ſaued from the fire of the laſt iudgement, which ſhall goe before the face of the Iudge: <hi>Which</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>will not burne the iust,
<note place="margin">Alcuinus de Trinit l. 3. c. 21 Orig. hom 3. in Pſal. 26.</note> but make them ſhine more cleare and bright.</hi> Alcuinus and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Gloſe, doe iumpe together with the former ſence. Origen vnderſtandeth it of Purgatorie, but it is a Purgatorie of his owne deuiſe, in that he maketh it not to be
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:15548:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>till after the laſt iudgement, and through which both Saint Peter and Saint Paul are to paſſe, holding that none can be free from the ſame but Chriſt himſelfe, no not the Diuels, for by it hee holdeth that they ſhall be purged.
<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in Pſalm.</note> And Saint Ambroſe holding the ſame from and with him, ſpeaketh after the ſame ſort: and yet notwithſtanding he addeth thereunto, how that the euill Teachers ſhall bee for a certaine time, after the laſt iudgement in Hell, and yet in the end they ſhall be ſaued: <hi>To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it may yet turne to ſome profit to haue belieued in Chriſt.</hi> But what proueth all this for our Purgatorie? And what will themſelues ſay of Gregorie,

               <p>In the 1. Corinthians 15. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the reſurrection, ſaith:

                  </gap>, <hi>if the dead riſe not againe?</hi> To bee baptiſed ſay they for the dead, that is to afflict themſelues for them, that is to doe all ſuch things, as may ſeeme to ſerue for the ſatisfying and purging of their ſinnes. Wherefore they are yet in ſome place, where they may bee relieued and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, Therefore in Purgatorie. Now this is nothing elſe, but to make themſelues continuall breakers of that Rule which ſaith: That a man ought not to reaſon or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any arguments from the places which are darke and doubtfull. Now they dare not denie, that there is any place in all the new Teſtament more obſcure euen for the litterall ſence then this. And notwithſtanding they will preſuppoſe and ſet downe any Expoſition thereof, after their owne fantaſies; whereas all the Diuines that were for the ſpace of fifteene hundred yeares were to ſeeke therein. And hardly are there as yet any found that can ſatisfie themſelues therein. For, one ſaith that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them, who ſeeing ſome die without Baptiſme, cauſed others that were aliue to bee baptiſed for them; ſo well aſſured they were of the reſurrection.

An other ſaith that this is to bee vnderſtood of ſuch as were bed-rid, or ſicke in their beds, and could not ariſe, or ſuch as were baptiſed, lying vppon their death bed, or in extreame perill of their life. An other, of thoſe which were dead and after baptiſed; to ſhew that Baptiſme was not onely a ſigne of the reſurrection of the body, but alſo of the ſoule. And thus Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may ſeeme to vnderſtand it in his Booke of the Reſurrection. Chryſoſtome refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to the words of Baptiſme, ſaying: <hi>If there be no reſurrection, then all that wee doe in Baptiſme, is but a play:</hi> Namely, becauſe in it is contained the figure, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance both of death, and of the reſurrection together. And Theodoret after the ſame manner, that he which is baptiſed, is buried with the Lord: <hi>In vaine</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>if the body be not to riſe againe with him.</hi> And Saint Thomas, is not farre off from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it in the ſame ſence. In a word, there are ſome which referre it to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of celebrating of Baptiſmes in Church-yardes; wherein the ordinarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the firſt Chriſtians were wont to be kept. Out of which of theſe old and auncient Expoſitions is it, that they collect and gather this Purgatorie? Or by which of the olde writers doe they approoue their owne, theſe men are they whome I aske, which make ſuch accompt of the Fathers, which thinke them all to bee on their ſide. So that it will ſuffice vs onely to denie their interpretation: Namely, that to be baptiſed, is to bee afflicted, is to pray for the dead, and in ſteade
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:15548:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereof, we will hold and affirme that to be baptiſed, in the text of the Goſpell which they pretend, is to die for the name of Chriſt, and to ſuffer Martyrdome. Chriſoſtome vpon theſe words:
<note place="margin">Luk. 12. Mark. 10. Chryſoſt. in Math. hom. 66</note> 
                  <hi>You may, ſaith the Lord, be baptiſed with the Baptiſme, wherewith I am baptiſed, &amp;c. Here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I promiſe you many good things; you ſhall purchaſe the Crowne of Martyrdome, and by a violent death, you ſhall depart out of this life, as I myſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> The ordinarie Gloſe: <hi>He ſpeaketh here of the Baptiſme of his paſsion.</hi> And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this is the place from whence they would drawe their Expoſition. What ſhameleſſe and impudent dealing is this, to expound, to be baptiſed, to ſignifie to be afflicted; and that to bee afflicted, ſhould ſignifie to pray for the dead, and that for thoſe dead which are in Purgatorie. Let them tell me, if this manner of reaſoning can bee vſed in any good Schoole without ſhame? But yet after all, to what end had it beene for Saint Paul to haue attempted the prouing of the reſurrection of bodies, by the ſoules tormented in Purgatorie? And what would his argument haue beene in the end? And why at the leaſt did they not hold themſelues, either to Cardinall Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, who ſaith, <hi>Pro mortuis, that is to ſay, for their ſinnes,</hi> although verie darkly: or yet for the better,
<note place="margin">Caietan. in 1.

Againe, the Goſpell is preached, to be heard, vnderſtood and receiued in faith.

               <p>In the firſt of S. Iohn: <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſinne that is not to death,
<note place="margin">1. Iohn 5.16.</note> let him aſke of God, and he will gine him life: to all them I ſay, which doe not ſinne vnto death.

<note place="margin">Auguſt. de cor. &amp; grat. c. 12.</note> or when they are dead. For ſuch then as haue ſhewed ſome repentance, or which haue ſinned venially, wee muſt pray both whiles they liue, and when they be dead. But how can this be gathered out of this text? wherein the Apoſtle ſpeaketh directly of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:15548:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>them with whom we liue,
<note place="margin">Idem in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir. ad Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. c. 82. Idem de ſcrm. Domini. in Monte. Tertul. l. de pudicitia.</note> and whoſe workes we ſee, of the dead, not ſo much as one word. They alleadge vnto vs S. Auguſtine, who expoundeth it of perpetuall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie: let them not then diſſemble, how that in another place hee expoundeth it of certaine kindes of ſinnes, as alſo doth Tertullian. Neither would I haue them to conceale it, how that the moſt parte of the old writers doe diſſent from Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, as Saint Ierome, Athanaſius, Chryſoſtome, Saint Baſill, Saint Ambroſe, &amp;c. all which though they vnderſtand by this ſinne vnto death, the ſinne againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, yet therewithall they vnderſtande, that this is not a finall impenitencie, which is not diſcerned but at the time of death: but an obſtinate ſinne which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the life time, and in the courſe of the ſame. Saint Mathew ſaith: <hi>That this ſinne is not pardoned either in this world or in the world to come.</hi> In this world, that is to ſay, in this life: and in this ſence our aduerſaries doe alledge it againſt vs; but they doe not remember themſelues of any thing els. The Apoſtle to the Hebrewes ſaith: <hi>It is impoſsible that ſuch perſons ſhould bee renewed by repentance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.</note> Then they may bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, yea ſinne vnto death before death. But what manner of concluſion will there follow hereof in the end? Wee muſt not pray for ſuch as ſinne vnto death, therefore wee muſt pray for the deade, which ſinne not vnto death? Againe, wee muſt pray, to the ende that life may bee giuen them, that is to ſay, to the ende that their ſinnes may bee pardoned. Now is it not a point of their doctrine, that ſinnes do not come in purgatorie, but that there is onely the puniſhment of ſins? but and if any ſinnes, yet none but thoſe that are ſleight ones? But in their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they except not any ſinne, ſaue that which is vnto death. To be ſhort, to ſuch as well conſider the text, it will appeare that they are ſo farre off from reaſoning accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, as that in deed they reaſon directly to the contrarie. And furthermore not one of the old writers, neither yet of the newe, doeth alleadge it to this purpoſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greateſt part do handle and expound the ſame, and that to another end.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are all the places of the new Teſtament, from which they go about to proue their purgatorie: places that are obſcure and hard and diuerſly interpreted by the Doctors, but either in a farre other ſence then our aduerſaries take them: or elſe myſtically and metaphorically for the moſt part, and therefore not to be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in any controuerſie of diuinitie, no more then in anie other: for controuerſies cannot bee diſcuſſed by textes in controuerſie. And this is the reaſon why the good man Perion ſaid: <hi>That in all the canonical ſcripture he knew not any place, eyther prouing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
<note place="margin">Roffenſis.</note> or praier for the dead.</hi> And the Biſhop of Rocheſter: <hi>That of a truth there is not any place for the prouing of the ſame, except it bee ſome ſuch as is very intricate.</hi> And Petrus a Soto after him: <hi>That there is not any cleare euidence and teſtimony in the ſcripture for Purgatorie: but that many other thinge: ought to bee belieued, which are not contained therein.</hi> To what end therefore ſerueth all this ſhameleſſe dealing, thus to tumble &amp; toſſe the ſcripture vpſide downe, thus to racke and torment all the textes one after another, ſeeing they know in their conſciences, that the ſcripture knoweth not any purgatorie? But for certaine, that text which knoweth not to agree any whit with their expoſition, doeth know well enough to admit and receiue ours: It doeth not know theirs,
<note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> being alwaies for the proofe of that third pretended place: for it ſaith, <hi>Who ſo ſhall belieue and be baptiſed, ſhall be ſaued: but hee that ſhall not haue belieued, ſhalbe condemned,

<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> for from that time ſaith the spirit, they reſt from their labours; bleſſed are they whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen.</hi> But according to their owne ſayings, the ſins of thoſe which are in their Purgatory, are they not remitted, &amp; are they not dead in the Lord? And yet what time muſt they indure in the burning and flaming fire of this purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie? And thus ſayeth Saint Paule: <hi>That there is no condemnation to them that are in

And S. Paule againe: <hi>Take no care for thoſe which ſleepe.</hi> All theſe places of ſcripture cannot ſtande with Purgatorie. But they haue very well knowne ours, euen Chriſt the eternall Son of God, who <hi>by himſelfe hath wrought the purging away of our ſinnes,

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we anſwere them, that the barre and iudgement ſeat that is directed by humane reaſon hath no place in the Church: that in that skill of the law which profeſſeth the defence and maintenance of Chriſtianitie, it is a ſhame to ſpeake without teſtimonie and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie out of the word, and that a great deale more, then to ſpeake in the ciuill law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law: But how much more ſhame is it then, when a man vndertaketh to ſpeake for Chriſtianitie, and holdeth a courſe contrarie to the ſcriptures. And this we haue learned from the ancient writers. Tertullian: <hi>Let vs reuerence the fulneſſe of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if we will not vndergoe the woe ordained for ſuch as adde vnto them.</hi> Baſill: <hi>This is to fall away from the faith, either to caſt away and cut off any parte of that which is written, or to adde any thing that is not.</hi> Chryſoſtome; <hi>The thoughtes of the hearers halt when they haue a doctrine deliuered them without any ſcripture.</hi> S. Auguſtine: <hi>Let vs ſee if this be taught in the law or prophets, or in the Gospell or Epiſtles.</hi> Gerſon in like manner: <hi>Let vs ſuspect all manner of reuelations, if they bee not confirmed by the law and the Prophetes.</hi> But theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers here alleadged haue alſo belieued Purgatorie. Let vs admit that it is ſo, (as it is not in deed) yet we anſwere as we haue done before: that we do not allow of the old fathers, as lawgiuers in the Church: <hi>For there is but one law maker</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>euen Ieſus Christ:</hi> and themſelues tooke it as an iniurie offred vnto them to be ſo reputed: only they accompted of themſelues as expounders of the law ordained by our Lord, and of the ſcriptures which he hath left vs. And this is the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that can be giuen them in the Church: and in this reſpect and conſideration we honour their bookes, we weigh and ponder their expoſitions; where they are found to differ one from another, we endeuour our ſelues to make our choice of the beſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thoſe which come neereſt vnto the analogie and proportion of faith. If wee doe otherwiſe, if wee admit of them as authours of doctrines, and not interpretors, wee ſhall be in danger to bee as we ſaid, Anabaptiſtes with Saint Cyprian; Montaniſtes
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:15548:154"/>with Tertullian, Chiliaſtes with Ireneus, &amp;c. In ſtead that wee are to abide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Chriſtians with Chriſt, whoſe <hi>voice the ſheepe heare:</hi> who <hi>alone hath the woraes of eternall life.</hi> Now we haue heretofore cited all the Doctors, to the interpreting of the places, produced and alleadged by our aduerſaries for purgatorie, who could not ſee it there where they did find it; who for the moſt part haue in the ſaid places found the contrarie: and yet we will proceed on further, as namely to ſhew, that the auncient fathers haue affirmed ſuch Maximes, as wherewith the Romiſh Purgatorie cannot ſtand: As that when they haue at any time ſpoken of it, they doe it not affirmatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but doubtfully, and not as of an article of religion, but as of a fantaſie or opinion that may bee propounded and receiued for arbitrarie: that for the moſt parte what they haue ſaide, cannot agree with that which wee are in controuerſie about at this day. And finally, that if they had belieued it for a neceſſarie article, they had colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and gathered from thence, as from a principle of faith, ſuch corollaries &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences as wee ſee at this day: which neuer came to light, till a long time after, &amp; one long after another, and that by the ſucceſſion of many ages. And to the end that this may more clearely be ſeene, let vs call to mind, at our entrance into the ſame, what purgatorie it is whereof we ſpeake, as namely of a certaine third place, whither the ſoules of the faithfull, dead in the faith of Chriſt, go at the time of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this life, there to bee tormented with fire, before they bee receiued into the place of bliſſe: yea and that ſo long, as vntill by the praiers and ſuffrages of thoſe that are liuing there be ſatiſfaction made for the temporall puniſhments due for the ſame: and that all the ſpottes of vncleanneſſe bee purged and cleanſed away: that is, for that (ſay they vnto vs) by faith in Chriſt, wee haue remiſſion of the fault and ſinne onely, and not of the eternall puniſhment due to the ſame, which by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and power of the keies is changed from being eternall and made temporall, and for that wee muſt of neceſſitie ſatiſfie this temporall puniſhment either in this life, or in the life to come by our ſelues, or by ſome others, &amp;c.</p>

But it is worth the noting, how that Origen had not as yet learned, that theſe puniſhmentes were mittigated and lightned by ſuffrages: for there is not found any maner of print or note of any ſuch thing in all his purgatorie. Theſe pollutions and ſinnes go for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:15548:156"/>no better then matter for the fire and torments, without any hope of releaſe or ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. And ſtill as theſe fantaſies continued and abode with ſome curious ſpirites, they were condemned in the fift generall Councell by the Eaſt Church,

               <p>Theſe fantaſticall dreames of Origen notwithſtanding, by reaſon of the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his learning did leaue their impreſſions in the Latine Church: whereupon Vincentius Lirinenſis had iuſt cauſe to ſay: <hi>That Origen his knowledge and zeale was a great temptation to the Chriſtian Church.</hi> Lactantius ſaith: That men are not iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged preſently after their death, but that they are kept in a common priſon vntill the day of iudgement, in which they are to bee tried by fire. This place is ill allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by our aduerſaries: for they do not place together the good &amp; the bad, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnfaithfull, at the time of their departing out of this life: neither do they hold that purgatorie ſleepeth without doing any thing, vnto the day of iudgement: for they will haue it occupied about the dead from the day of their death. Againe it is apparant, that in the time of Lactantius, the doctrine of the Church was cleane contrarie: For Euſebius, as we haue ſaid, comparing the opinion of the Platoniſtes therewith, maketh but two eſtates and conditions after this life: whereas they made three. But let it be for the making of the compariſon the more full, that hee did not altogether forget the third.</p>

Verily, there is no man that can bee ignorant how greatly Saint Ambroſe did eſteeme of Origen, when as the moſt part of his expoſitions are tranſlated word for word from him. And thereupon likewiſe his opinion touching Purgatorie, doth nothing differ, and therefore alſo no leſſe worthy to be condemned then his: <hi>All men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which are, haue beene, or ſhall be, the one onely Chriſt excepted, ſhall be purged by fire: The ſonnes of Leui, Ezechiel, Daniel, &amp;c. if they be not conſumed, yet at the least they ſhalbe fired: if they be not drowned, yet they ſhall bee wette and dipt in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for ſo was Iohn the Euangeliſt himſelfe, whom the Lord loued ſo much: ſo was Saint Peter, which receiued the keies of heauen: There is not any one but Chriſt onely which doeth not ſmel of this fire, who is the righteouſneſſe of God not hauing any ſinne: ſo that in him there is nothing found for this fire to conſume or burne.</hi> And this hee amplifieth by two ſeuerall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories: the one taken from the glittering ſword which was ſet at the entrance into Paradiſe: the other from the people of Iſrael, which went through the red ſea, &amp;c. He addeth hereto, that this triall and proofe by fire ſhall bee made in the day of iudgement, by the vniuerſall burning of the world, which ſhall vniuerſally purge all men, but euery one according to his nature: euen as the fire doth melt the lead otherwiſe then it doth the gold, &amp;c. S. Hillarie no leſſe addicted to Origen,
<note place="margin">Hilar. in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in pſal. 118.</note> holdeth the ſame opinion, and proceedeth yet further, ſaying: <hi>If the virgine Marie, the virgin of God muſt alſo vndergo the ſentence of this iudgement; (of this fire hee ſpake before, through which wee muſt all paſſe,) who is hee that dare deſire to bee iudged of God?</hi> And in another place hee ſaith:

In a certaine place he ſuffered it to eſcape according to the opinion then currant: As, that after this life ſuch as haue not husbanded their ground well are in daunger either of the fire of purgation, or of eternall fire: notwithſtanding that hee vſeth theſe wordes: <hi>

But in the booke of the Citie of God, hee reckeneth vp all the opinions of Origen and others depending on him, who carried themſelues in his time in the Church, as thoſe who had founded themſelues vppon the mercifull clemencie and fatherly mildneſſe of God miſexpounded, and confuteth them all, bringing them backe from their pretended likelihood of truth, vnto the truth it ſelfe, and from their conceited fantaſie, to the infallible ſcriptures: <hi>Thou wilt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the wicked Chriſtians may in the end be ſaued by theſe pains of purgatorie, becauſe that God is mercifull: it muſt then alſo follow, that the Deuils may alſo bee ſaued, that ſo hee may bee ſo much the more mercifull: for it is ſaid equally and indifferently to the one and the other:

For either he reſteth in the light of euerlaſting happines, with the iuſt and righteous men, and Chriſt our Lord; or els he is tormented in darknes with the vnrighteous, and the Deuill which is their prince.</hi> They obiect vnto vs, that Saint Ierome ſaith in his commentaries vpon the Prouerbes: That ſoules are deliuered out of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie by Maſſes. But they ſhould rather be aſhamed: ſeeing that the worde Maſſe is not found, no not ſo much as once onely in all Saint Ierome. Seeing alſo that this booke cannot be his, becauſe it citeth S. Gregorie, who liued more then a hundred and fiftie yeares after. And in deed this booke is found written by hand vnder the name of Beda: and there is neither the time, nor the ſtile, that are repugnant to the ſame. And the ſame is well allowed of by Marianus Victorius, Biſhop of Amerin, who cauſed them to be imprinted amongſt the works of S. Ierome vnder the name of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.

And Marke Biſhop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his Apologie which he preſented for the Greeke Churches in the Councell of Baſill, auoucheth that he neuer thought of purgatorie. In like manner we haue ſeene here before, that he hath razed the foundations there of, partly by eſtabliſhing the ful remiſſion of ſinnes in Chriſt, and partly in acknowledging but two places or waies to be gone after this life.</p>

But theſe places were neuer imagined to put any diſtinction and difference betwixt faithfull and faithfull, but betwixt the faithfull and vnfaithfull. Againe they neuer meant, that the faithfull were there in any torment but in reſt, not in any heat of burning fire, but in a place of refreſhment, which likewiſe they called by the name of <hi>Refrigerium.</hi> And this place wherein they abode waiting and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the day of iudgement, they called <hi>Abrahams boſome, the ſweet reſt vnder the Altar, the Paradice;</hi> alluding vnto the place of S.

But what maketh all this for purgatorie? but onely that it may ſerue to daſle the eyes of men? For that this was an opinion at that time helde as indifferent in the Church, it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in that that Saint Auguſtine handling the ſame in his bookes of retractations, leaueth it vndecided: whereas Chryſoſtome in many places ſpeaketh to the contrary, cutting all off in a worde, As, that the righteous ſhall ſee God face to face, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more by faith, &amp;c. That death coupleth vs with the companie that is with Chriſt, where the Cherubines glorifie God, where the Seraphins flie, where we ſhall ſee Saint Paule, &amp;c. In ſo much as that it was pronounced hereticall, and that by the name of the hereſie of the Armenians by Innocent the third, Benedict the eleuenth, &amp; by the decree of the Councell held at Florence, where it was ſaid, that the ſoules of the ſaints at their departure out of this life, did inioy the preſence of God: Notwithſtanding that Pope Iohn the 22. had made a Decree in fauour of that doctrine: namely, that the Vniuerſitie of Paris ſhould be reſtrained from admitting any to proceed Doctor. or in any other degree of diuinity, which did not take an oath, that ſoules did not ſee God before the day of iudgement. And this is verified by Gulielmus Occan in his booke intituled: <hi>Opus nonaginta trium dieru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And Pope Adrian the 6. vpon the 4. booke of Sentences, both which do condemne it. And thus as hitherto they haue not any third place, where the ſouls are purged in the time betwixt death &amp; the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For that of Origen, S. Ambr. &amp; S. Hillary helpeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not a dodkin: that of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines refuteth this of theirs, and being wel looked on, appeareth to be a fire of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, a ſpirituall, but not a materiall fire, &amp; moreouer ſuch a one as is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and meere arbitrarie.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:15548:158"/>but of contentation to be receiued, by the attending and wayting for of the glorie to come, in like manner they are condemned of hereſie by themſelues. And therefore it remaineth, that if they will needes haue it to haue beene at this time, which is fiue hundred yeares after Chriſt; that yet they goe and find it amongſt the Gentiles. And great in deede is the antiquitie of that; for it was before the comming of Chriſt many ages: and yet notwithſtanding it is verie young and a meere Nouice in the Church of Chriſt; becauſe it is without Chriſt, and out of the Church.</p>

As that, if the auncient Church, which impoſed theſe Satisfactions vpon them, that ſo they might let them goe to God in peace, did as ordinarily giue them abſolution; then it cannot but certainely proue, that it had not learned any thing of this Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. But the truth is, that in the times of thoſe great and continuall perſecutions, which the Chriſtians ſuffered for the ſpace of three hundred yeares, onely ſome little reſpite and reſt giuen vnto them, many did renounce and belie the profeſsion of the faith of Chriſt, (who before in the calme and peaceable times had giuen their names thereunto,) becomming readie to returne to Idolatrie, as the times chaunged and altered. Now againſt this leuitie &amp; in conſtancie the auncient Church did not thinke any puniſhments that could be inflicted, to be too hard or ſharpe; by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it thought to find out the ſinceritie or hypocriſie of the penitents, as alſo their liuely, or otherwiſe dull and dead ſence and feeling that they had for their ſinne. Wherefore the end and ſcope of this courſe was to bring them to ſackcloth and aſhes; and to ſuffer them to paſſe many daies, in making humble petitions, to bee reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Church, who either had ſacrificed, or burnt incenſe to Idols; or who had giuen the Goſpels and holy Bookes to bee burned, and who were therefore called <hi>Sacrificati, Thurificantes, Traditores, Libellatici, &amp;c.</hi> yea and which is yet more, to the end they might adde more carefull heede to ſuch as ſhould offer, to enter themſelues into the number of the Church: there were ſome that would not receiue <hi>Lapſos paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes,</hi> any more then once to the taking of penance after baptiſme. And Nouatus proceeded yet further, and denied it them altogether, for the which he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Church, which alſo thereupon,
<note place="margin">Cypr. l. 4. Ep. 2</note> from that time forward began to mitigate theſe puniſhments. What then? And now if they died before the time, were they not bound by the Church? And how then did they ſatisfie theſe puniſhments?
<note place="margin">Idem. l. 3. Ep. 8 Serm. 5. de Lapſis.</note> Verily the order was good, that before they had fully made ſuch ſatisfaction, they were not to be receiued to abſolution, or to haue any communion with the Church. But as duely was it obſerued on the other ſide, that if they were in daunger of death, before the time of ſuch accompliſhment, that then notwithſtanding they were receiued into the peace, abſolution and communion of the ſame. Aſſuredly not with any purpoſe or intent that they ſhould euer haue gone into Purgatorie, for they neuer thought of it: But <hi>to the end</hi> ſaith S.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:15548:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>Contrariwiſe S.

It was ſaid vnto him: If you offer the peace of the Church vnto penitents, there will not be any moe confeſſors, there will not be any moe Martyrs; (for this was the glorie of our fathers.) But ſaith hee there will contin ually remaine a great difference betwixt the one and the other. <hi>Lapſi,</hi> ſaith he, ſuch as are fallen, ſtand to aske pardon: they are as it were in priſon, vntill ſuch time as they haue exactly ſatisfied the Church: they are as it were refined by fire, through the long griefe which they indure by their penance: in a word, they ſuffer much, before they obtaine the peace of the Church; and in this peace, peace with God and that which followeth. On the contrarie the Martyrs and confeſſors abiding in peace with God, doe not paſſe through all theſe ſorrowes and griefes, they paſſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily into glorie, they receiue the reward of their conſtancie, all their ſinnes are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in their ſuffering of death, &amp;c.

               <p>And yet they obiect,
<note place="margin">Prayers for the dead.</note> you cannot ſay, but that the Church hath belieued Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſeeing it hath praied for the dead. Neither doe we denie, but that this cuſtome is auncient enough: but on the contrarie we ſay, how that the Church neuer praied for the dead, vnder the old Teſtament: not Ioſeph for Iacob, who was notwithſtanding verie carefull for the embalming and burying of him:
<note place="margin">2 Kings 18.</note> nor Dauid for Abſalom, whoſe death ſo much grudged and mooued his tender and fatherly affections; nor for the child which he begot of Berſabe, but on the contrarie after that hee knew him dead, he gaue ouer his faſting and praier. And as for Machabeus, if any man obiect him vnto vs, we anſwere that hee was the firſt and the laſt in that action. The Church then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and vnder the Law, neere hand for the ſpace of foure thouſand yeares knew not any Purgatorie. And further wee affirme, that our Lord hath not left any thing, any word or mention of the ſame vnto his Apoſtles, but on the contrarie, <hi>that he hath left the dead to burie the dead.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9. &amp; 9.</note> S. Paul ſaith vnto vs: <hi>Bee not carefull and penſiue for them which are a ſleepe.</hi> Amongſt ſo many arguments to prooue the reſurrection, that is not once touched amongſt them,
<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.</note> which yet would haue made for the purpoſe. Likewiſe we ſee them waſh the bodies of the dead, and burie them carefully, and to comfort one an other in the midſt of their mourning, in the hope of the reſurrection: but as for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, they ſay nothing of it. Wherefore the Church of Chriſt from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hath not knowne Purgatorie. How came they then into the Church? Verily euen through the conduite, that brought in Purgatorie; the inuention of men, and the imitation of the Gentiles, who being but ſlenderly and ſuperficially inſtructed of the ſtate of the ſoule after death, rent and launced themſelues ouer the dead, made feaſts vppon their graues, as though thereby they would haue recouered them and brought them againe to life, and ſacrificed to the infernall Gods for their ſhadowes and likeneſſes, this humane affection and carnall loue haunted them ſo, as that it wrought prayers out of them, yea euen to the time of death and after alſo. But theſe
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15548:159"/>courſes of afflicting themſelues, in ſuch extreame manner were forbidden the people of God, as being better inſtructed and taught in the holy word of God; and theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections alſo bounded within the limits of his Law. And this is the cauſe that kept them from falling away ſo lightly, to the imitation of the Gentiles. From the Gentiles, this opinion was ſlily and ſmoothly conueighed into the Apocripha books of one Clement, Abdias Babilonius, Hermas, and ſuch like; and as it was no ſtraunge thing to thoſe who were drawne from their Paganiſme, ſo was it nothing vnplauſible to them, to retaine the ſame: the Paſtors admitting it for indifferent, and nothing looking to the conſequence, and that which might fall out in the end, did let it alone by ſufferance. Whereas if they had ſeene how farre Sathan hath vndermined thereby the merite of Chriſt, the foundation of ſaluation; they would vndoubtedly haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and gaine-ſaied the ſame according to the neceſsitie of the cauſe, and kept themſelues to the rule of the Apoſtle, repeated by S. Auguſtine, who ſaith:

The Paganes had accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to offer, when they were dead, as alſo when their kinsfolkes or friends departed and left them: now the Chriſtians ſeeing the ſame, and being aſhamed to bee behind in humanitie and naturall affection, doe in like manner offer, but ſo, as that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their oblations to bee imployed to better vſes, as to the feeding of the poore; following the counſaile mentioned in Tobiah: <hi>Set thy bread vpon the Graue, &amp;c.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans had their yearely birth feaſts; the Chriſtians celebrated the day of their true ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth or regeneration, of the Martyrdome, confeſsion, and death of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt. And Beatus Rhenanus noteth verie well in this place:
<note place="margin">Index expurg. p. 82.</note> 
                  <hi>From hence ſprung the originall of the yearely remembrances and feasts:</hi> Where the Fathers of Trent haue cauſed <hi>Antiquitie</hi> to be put in place of <hi>the originall.</hi> Likewiſe Tertullian ſaith that this is a doctrine, neither grounded in the Scriptures, nor yet vpon any Apoſtolicall tradition, but onely growne vp by cuſtome. <hi>Si legem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>expoſtules Scripturarum, nulla legis tibi traditio pretendetur:</hi> but <hi>Obſeruationem conſuetudo roborauit: There is no Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that can here be pretended, but cuſtome hath giuen force and ſtrength to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</hi> And this cuſtome taken and raiſed from the good intents of ſome faithfull perſons, and not from the Apoſtles: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doſt thou not thinke, that it is lawfull for euerie faithfull perſon to conceiue and ſet downe for a Law what he thinketh to be agreeable vnto God, conuenient for diſcipline, or furthering vnto ſaluation, &amp;c.</hi> And by the like propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition entred the hereſie of Montanus both into his head, and after into the Church. And to be ſhort, he ſetteth this cuſtome in the ranke of many others which he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp there: As, <hi>to dip the child thriſe in Baptiſme, to take a tast of Milke and Honie before hand, which they called Infantation, to offer for birth dayes, not to kneele or bow downe vpon the Lords dayes, &amp;c.</hi> All which are long ſince aboliſhed out of the Church of Chriſt, and ſo alſo ſhould this giue place by vertue of the ſame aboliſhment, as made of the ſame ſtuffe, and ſo alſo by conſequent their Purgatorie.</p>
               <p>In S. Cyprian, who followeth him cloſe at the heele,
<note place="margin">Cypr.

And this was continued by certaine Chriſtians in the time of S. Auguſtine, not without great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence taken thereat, and this he complaineth of, as likewiſe,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. Ep. 64</note> that he cannot remedie or redreſſe it but by force. Such is the tyrannie that cuſtome practiſeth vppon men. And of theſe offerings, or rather teſtamentarie Legacies, the Canon ſpeaketh:
<note place="margin">C. Qui Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones. xiii. q. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Such as denie the Church the offerings of the dead, ought to be held as murtherers of the poore, in as much as they rob them of their foode and nouriſhment, &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe feaſts made for the poore, were qualified with the name of ſacrifices and oblations, as it may bee ſeene in many
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:15548:160"/>places of Tertuilian,

But what maketh all this either for Maſſes for the dead, or elſe for Purgatorie? And what will this prooue to, on the contrarie ſide, if we ſhow that they which offered theſe oblations and praiers; or to ſpeake more fitly theſe memorials and remembrances in the ſeruice of the Church; did the ſame for ſuch perſons as they belieued to be already in reſt and euerlaſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie; ſo farre off were they from preſuppoſing them to be in Purgatorie? Tertullian ſaith, that the wife offereth for the husband, and the husband for the wife, <hi>Annuis diebus dormitionis eius, &amp;c. From yeare to yeare vpon the day of his death:</hi> And this is done in their dwelling houſe, with their kinsfolkes, as their owne mouthes confeſſe. And what hath this that is common with the Prieſt his pretended ſacrifice? Hee ſaith alſo that they doe craue the one for the other, betwixt the time of death and the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>refrigerium;</hi> and <hi>conſortium</hi> in the ſame, that is to ſay: That it would pleaſe God to giue reſt vnto the fore deceaſed;
<note place="margin">Tertull. l. 4. cont. Marcion &amp; l. de Anima</note> and to both, to meete in the reſurrection. Who knoweth not that Tertullian calleth, <hi>Refrigerium, the place of refreſhment,</hi> the boſome of Abraham, the place of the righteous where they abide, waiting the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>Wherein</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>they are from their death, vnto the finall end and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all things:</hi> And ſo by conſequent, that this their practiſe is nothing elſe but a continuing of this naturall affection, which cannot bee ſtaied; and which according to the meaſure and quantitie, wherein it calleth them to mind, whome it loueth, can not but lay open and ſhew foorth it ſelfe by making vowes, for the procuring of their proſperitie, and will not ſuffer it ſelfe to be perſwaded thereof, howſoeuer in deed it bee, neither in a manner would haue it ſo, to the end it may not lacke matter to doe them good, wherein poſsibly it can?

<note place="margin">Cypr. l. 1. Ep. 9.</note> but onely in durableneſſe? S. Cyprian ſeemeth to ſpeake rawly: <hi>To offer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the dead, to celebrate a ſacrifice, Pro dormitione corum, for their falling a ſleepe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">l. 3.

If this were any thing tending vnto propitiation, how could it fit with that ſentence of S. Auguſtine:
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de verb. A poſt. Serm. 17. Innoc. C. cum Marth. de cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat. Miſſ. l. 4. Ep. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſo prayeth for a Martyr, doth offer him iniurie?</hi> Which Pope Innocent the third applieth vnto all Saints. Thus S. Cyprian ſaith vnto vs: <hi>Wee offer ſacrifices;</hi> ſpeaking of Celerinus his kinred, all which almoſt was honoured with the crowne of Martyrdome; whome notwithſtanding he affirmeth to bee crowned in heauen. And on the contrarie hee will not haue any mention made at the Altar, that is to ſay, in the publike prayers, <hi>Pro dormitione, for the reſt</hi> of a certaine man named Victor; becauſe he had, contrarie to the receiued Diſcipline and gouernment, cauſed a Prieſt to be charged with the keeping of a child in his nonage. Whereby we ſee that theſe prayers and commemorations, were but to put vs in mind of the vertuous liues of the Saints, and not for the making of any fatisfaction for ſinnes. And this is that which Rhenanus ſaith:
<note place="margin">B. Rhenanus. in l. ad Martyr.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacrificia pro Martyribus offerri, ſic accipiendum, ni fallor, vt pro eis, idem valeat, quod commemoratione corum, &amp;c. The ſame which Cyprian ſaith, to offer ſacrifices for the Martyrs, that is to ſay, for the renuing of their memories; in at much as the calling to mind of their death and ſuffering, did offer matter of offering oblations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe were rather gratulatorie and ioyfull prayers, as by the which thankes was giuen to God, for that he had ſhewed ſuch fauour vnto the Martyr; and thereupon they prayed vnto him with one conſent and voice, that hee would continue to ſhew the like vnto his faithfull ſeruants that are aliue: that ſo the Church may ſing, Gaudeamus in Domino, &amp;c.

And in like manner of Theodoſius: <hi>He is deliuered from this doubtfull fight and warfare, he inioyeth an euerlaſting light, eternall tranquilitie, &amp;c. Hee is glorified amongst the companie of Saints; there he embraceth Gratian, he beholdeth in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt the temple of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> And he ſpeaketh, ſaith he, full aſſuredly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently: <hi>For as much as they are dead in the faith of Chriſt, ſeeing the Lord was made ſinne, to the end that he might take away the ſinne of the world, to the end that wee might be all in him the righteouſneſſe of God, no more</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſlaues of ſinne, but ſealed vp for the reward of righteouſneſſe.</hi> In like manner his prayers could not poſsibly be vnderſtood of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, in as much, (as we haue ſeene) as he gaue it no place, vntill the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With the ſame intent and mind S. Auguſtine praied for his mother, ſaying: <hi>I pray thee O Lord for her ſinnes, heare me by the medicine of his wounds, which was hanged vpon the Croſſe, and ſitteth at thy right hand, making interceſsion for vs: Pardon her and enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iudgement with her. And I doe verily belieue that thou haſt done this which I haue prayed thee for, but approue O Lord and heare witneſſe with Voluntariaoris mei, the free offerings of my mouth,
<note place="margin">Epiphan. cont. Aerium l. 3. t. 1 haereſ. 75.</note> &amp;c.</hi> This argument was more throughly canuaſed and hotly dealt in about the yeare 500. in the time of Epiphanius, who concealeth not or hideth the ſame from vs, but ſetteth downe the verie ſame wordes: <hi>That this is no commaundement of the father; but an inſtruction and leſſon taught by the mother, that is to ſay, by the Church.</hi> Aerius found himſelfe offended at theſe prayers for the dead, which paſſed meaſure. He put foorth this queſtion: Wherefore are the names of the deceaſed repeated and recited after their death? And to what end doe praiers ſerue for thoſe that are taken out of this life? If it be to the end that they may not ſuffer for their ſinnes, &amp;c. Heere verily were a place to anſwere him, that there is a Purgatorie: That thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted hence, without hauing ſatisfied for their ſinnes, are relieued by ſuch ſuffrages, &amp;c. But on the contrarie what dooth Epiphanius preſuppoſe and ſet downe for the foundation of the matter in queſtion? Verily, euen the quite contrarie: <hi>That ſuch as the liuing pray for, are, and liue, in the preſence of the Lord, and that by theſe prayers, ſuch as are as yet trauelling this worldly pilgrimage, doe witneſſe their hope.</hi> S. Chryſoſtome hath ſpoken of theſe prayers for the dead, with greater aduantage then any others: For that which Tertullian hath called <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> Epiphanius a <hi>Decree,</hi> or <hi>Tradition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> he hath called <hi>an Apoſtolicall Tradition.</hi> But he is confuted in one word by S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, and S. Gregorie; who ſaith that the Apoſtles vſed no other prayer in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of ſeruice, then the Lords prayer. But yet for all that ſhall we thinke that hee praied for ſoules in Purgatorie, when as hee belieued not any ſuch thing? Nay verily, but rather for them which are with Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. 3, ad Philip. Idem hom. 4. ad Hebr.</note> 
                  <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with their king, not any more beholding him as in a mirrour, no longer loking vp vnto him by the eyes of faith; but face to face. For elſe what ſhuld be the meaning of theſe flaming Lamps, but that we beare theſe glorious Champions companie home to their houſes, after their combat finiſhed and accompliſhed? As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what ſhould bee the meaning of theſe Hymnes; but that we glorifie God and giue him thankes for that hee hath crowned the deceaſed? That he hath ſet him at libertie from all griefe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and that he keepeth him now euen with himſelfe? Theſe then are all of them nothing elſe but actions of ioy and reioycing. And if thou marke what thou ſingeſt at that time, it is Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere anima mea in requiem tuam: Flie O my ſoule into thy reſt; for the Lord hath dealt graciouſly with thee. And againe, I wil not feare the euil &amp; wicked perſons, becauſe that thou art with me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem hom. 70 ad Antioch. in Math. hom. 32 in Ioh. 61.</note> In an other place: <hi>The faithfull dying</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhal take his flight vp into the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Angels, ſo that he ſhal not be to be found, euen at the time of his funerall.</hi> And in deed the Liturgies which they obiect ſo much vnto vs, ſhould ſo much the more confirme them in this point. That of Saint Baſil: <hi>Remember thoſe O Lord which ſleepe in hope of the reſurrection.</hi> Would he in their conſcience call Purgatorie a ſleepe?

And what ſhall wee ſay of the Maſſe vſed at this day,
<note place="margin">Hierony. apud.

So hard a thing it is and alwayes hath beene, to vpholde and maintaine a lie againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>They replie: And what then was the end of praying for the dead?
<note place="margin">In what ſence they praied for the dead. Orig. l. 3. in Iob</note> We cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſound the reaſon of this, then by the line of the Fathers themſelues which did practiſe it.

Saint Denis: <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doth the Miniſter pray vnto God, that he will pardon the dead,
<note place="margin">Dionyſ. c. 7. Eccleſ. Hierar.</note> and place him in the region of the liuing? For ſeeing that euerie man is there handled, according to his life: and that he hath now ended the ſame; what can ſuch prayers preuaile and helpe him?</hi> Heere was to bee aunſwered according to the doctrine receiued and taught by the Church of Rome: That this was to free him out of the paines of Purgatorie. But in deed what is his anſwere? That the praiers of good and vertuous men, doe neuer faile of their fruit: That God rendreth to the faithfull according to their workes; but in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, as that he blotteth out their ſpots and imperfections, for his mercie ſake, (then it is not by the rigour and ſeueritie of Purgatorie:) That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the promiſes of God made vnto the faithfull, be alreadie effected and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that yet the Miniſter doth craue the ſame of God, for three reaſons. Firſt, to ſhew himſelfe deſirous, according to Chriſtian vnitie, that gifts and good things might be beſtowed vpon others, euen as hee would wiſh or deſire them for himſelfe. Secondly, to confirme and aſſure the hearts of ſuch as are preſent, of the performance of thoſe good things, which God promiſeth in the Scriptures to thoſe that fall a ſleepe, that is to ſay, die in him. And thirdly, to declare vnto them the iudgement of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the charge which is giuen him from God, to bind and to looſe, in admitting and receiuing of ſome, and reiecting of other ſome by his teſtimonie, as if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed and carried them <gap reason="foreign">

S. Ambroſe giueth vs other reaſons: <hi>Griefe and ſorrow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is oftentimes the comfort of the grieuing. And in good affections there is likewiſe a certaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in weeping: but we content and ſatisfie our ſelues in ſome manner, by ſpeaking of him whome we haue loſt, &amp;c.</hi> What other thing could he ſay of ſuch as he witneſſed to bee dead in Chriſt, and by conſequent liuing, and raigning with him?

And in deede Caſſander in his aduiſe to the Emperour Maximilian,
<note place="margin">Caſſand. in conſult. c. de iterat.

               </p>
               <p>Saint Auguſtine remaineth, who ſeemeth to them to bee more fauourable then all the reſt: and behold the reaſons that hee yeeldeth. He prayeth for his mother, though preſuppoſing her to bee alreadie in heauen: Prayer then for the dead, being vſed in the ſame ſence that hee vſeth it, dooth not preſuppoſe any Purgatorie. Of the calling to memorie and reherſall of the dead which was made at the Altar, that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. Dci. l. c. 9.</note> in the ſeruice of the Church, he deliuereth this as an occaſion: That it was to ſhew the Communion that euen the dead haue in the Church, who ceaſe not to bee members of the ſame, though they raigne already with Chriſt, and be abſent from this life. Againe, that the friends of the deceaſed, may receiue this conſolation, that they which are aſleepe in Chriſt, how infirme and weake ſo euer, are not excluded and ſhut out from his kingdom, but receiued into eternal happines, becauſe of the Son of God made a ſacrifice for vs, whome they haue participated in the Euchariſt. But as hee was vrged &amp; drawne by the ſtrife &amp; contention of the time (for there was then much to do

               <p>What doe wee gather out of all this diſcourſe? Verily, firſt: That theſe prayers haue no foundation or ground either in the olde or new Teſtament. Secondly, that they are proceeded partly from humane affections; and partly from the imitation of the Pagans. Thirdly, that the old Fathers vſed them for thoſe whome they belieued alreadie to enioy eternall life; as the Apoſtles, Prophets, Martyrs, the holy Virgine, &amp;c. Or we may ſay better, according to the manner wherin they prayed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, for the Soules of the Popes, Paul the third, and Iulius the third. For thoſe which liue and die in a moſt holy manner, can they poſsibly according to their owne doctrine abide ſo long in Purgatorie? Fourthly, that it was then in regard of their ſoules, a holy deſire, and to be taken in like ſence, as when we ſay, liue O Chriſt, liue O God, &amp;c. whome wee know to raigne eternally: In regard of their bodies a prayer vnto God, that it would pleaſe him to glorifie them in the reſurrection, &amp;c. Fiftly, that they were made rather in conſideration of the liuing, then of the dead, to eaſe them of their griefe, and confirme them in their faith: inſtructions that may bee taken at a better hand and warrant from the Apoſtle: <hi>Torment not your ſelues about them which are a ſleepe, &amp;c.</hi> Sixtly, that they made them not vpon any conſideration of Purgatorie; ſeeing that amongſt ſo many reaſons of ſo many Doctors, liuing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ages and places, not any one before Saint Auguſtine, hath alleadged Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Seuenthly, that theſe obſeruations and reaſons ſo diuers and manifold doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto vs, that it was at that time held as an indifferent doctrine; as alſo how that the greater ſort doe call it a Cuſtome, a Decree, an Inſtitution, &amp;c. Eightly, that Saint Auguſtine himſelfe, who alone, after many other better reaſons, alleadgeth Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, cannot make any good proofe of the ſame; ſeeing he himſelfe doth not couer or conceale what doubt hee was in whether there were a Purgatorie or not. Likewiſe he deliuereth contrarie aſſertions, whereby there is great apparance and likelyhood, that he did not reuoke or vnſay any thing, but ſo farre as hee was wonne, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed by the headſtrong conceipt of men, ſeming in the light of nature, to know that which they had neuer heard or ſeene. Finally, that the prayers for the dead, which haue no foundation in the world, ought not to haue any more authoritie in the Church, then Baptiſme for the dead, practiſed ſay the ancients, but not approued from the time of the Apoſtles; or the Euchariſt giuen into the mouth of the dead; the one and the other proceeding from the ſame naturall affections, and yet both the one and the other aboliſhed, and baniſhed out of the Church.</p>

Now it is not to be forgotten, that that which was to be ſeene very weake and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in S. Auguſtine, for to ſtrengthen this new building withall, hath beene ſince that time, vnderpropped by counterfait and fained writings, by men willing that way to imploy their vttermoſt indeauour thus labouring by vntruth to eſtabliſh a lie; and mans deuice and inuention, by notorious and hainous crimes. And to that end, ſome haue attributed vnto him the Bookes,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de ver. &amp; falſ. paenit. c. 71.</note> 
                  <hi>De vera &amp; falſa paenitentia;</hi> made in deede by Monkes, though they be commonly cited in his name, where he ſaith: <hi>Let him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth to conuert and turne too long, paſſe through the fire of Purgatorie, which is more painefull and grieuous, then all the puniſhment that man can indure in this life.</hi> A Sermon alſo of the day of the dead, or of the remembrance of all the deceaſed; where they haue made him ſpeake in the ſame tearmes and manner of ſpeach. A booke notwithſtanding wherein the Author himſelfe alleadged S. Auguſtine: as alſo the feaſt, not being as yet receiued into the Church in his time; but inſtituted by Odilo Abbot of Clugni more then 500. yeares after. And yet which is more, there are ſome that haue deuiſed an Epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from S. Cyril, Bb. of Ieruſalem, to S. Auguſtine, for to confirme him in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Purgatorie: Cyril I ſay, whoſe life S. Ierome did write whiles he liued; writing to S. Auguſtine of the myracles of Saint Ierome after his death: In which Epiſtle there is mention made: How that S. Ierome appeared vnto a certaine man named Euſebius, and commaunded him to caſt his ſacke ouer three dead bodies which ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therupon riſe, therby confounding the hereſie, which denied Purgatory: That theſe three men thus raiſed againe, made their abode amongſt men for the ſpace of twentie dayes, declared how that S. Ierome had beene the meanes of their ſeeing of Hell and Purgatorie: That all whatſoeuer miſerie all the men in this world had indured from Adam vnto that time, did not come any thing neere vnto the paines and puniſhment, that is therein, &amp;c. And that had not Saint Ierome come in the meane time, they had beene neere to haue receiued the ſentence of condemnation, for not hauing belieued it, &amp;c. Thus we may ſee (a thing then which nothing is more naturall) the doctrine of lyes maintained and nouriſhed by a lie it ſelfe.</p>

<note place="margin">Purgatorie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched by Gregorie. Anno. 600. Deut. 18.11. Eſay. 8.19. Auguſt. de cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra pro mortuis gerend. Vpon what foundation he buildeth his doctrine. Gregor. Magn. in Dialog.</note> they are conſtrained to haue recourſe to Gregorie Bb. of Rome, liuing about the yeare 600, euen vnto that Gregorie, which of the cuſtome of the Gentiles, made a Law in the Church of Chriſt; of Origen his curioſities, a neceſſarie deuotion; of the ſpeculations of the olde Fathers who had gone before him, a grounded principle and firme Maxim; and of S. Auguſtines doubt, an affirmatiue doctrine: but grounded alſo altogether vpon other raaſons, then had bene alleadged by the former, as reuelations, apparitions of ſpirits, and others ſuch like deluſions, directly contrarie to that which is ſaid in the Law: <hi>Who ſo goeth to aske counſell of the dead, is an abhomination vnto the Lord:</hi> as alſo againſt the Maxim which S. Auguſtine is ſo carefull for to proue: <hi>That the ſoules of the dead inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle not with the affaires of thoſe that are aliue.</hi> The doctrin then of S. Gregorie, in brief is: That as at the breake of the day and in a browne colour, the darke is mingled with the light (&amp; is called the twylight,) ſo the neerer we come to the day of iudgement, ſo much the more inter-courſe and communitie ſhall there bee betwixt ſpirits and men. What ſolide or ſound ſtuffe can hee picke out of this foundation; ſeeing hee preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:15548:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſetteth downe the end of the world to bee as then? And this is the cauſe why (ſaith hee) that men doe attaine (ſpeaking of his owne time,) to know the eſtate and condition of Soules, a thing leſſe knowne to ſuch as went before. Of Paſchaſius his ſoule, he learneth how that it indured his Purgatorie, amidſt the ſcaldings of hotte waters, becauſe that in a certaine ſchiſme falling out amongſt the Popes, he tooke part with Laurence &amp; not with Symmachus. And thereupon he inferreth that good ſoules which halt and come ſhort, be it neuer ſo little, in the workes of righteouſneſſe, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained &amp; kept backe for a like proportion of time from the inioying of heauen. From the ſoule of a certaine Lord, how that it ſerued at the bathes to pull off the hoſe and ſhoes of all ſuch as came to them; vntill the time that a certain Prieſt, to whom it made it ſelfe knowne, had offered two loaues, ſuch as had beene accuſtomed to bee offered for it. As alſo from the ſoule of a Monke who died, hauing in ſtore the ſumme of three Crownes, how, when there was a holy day kept in his name, it receiued the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Purgatorie, &amp;c. Hee inferreth, that when the treſpaſſes are not vnpardonable, there is meanes to procure a remedy and helpe for the ſame, by the offering of a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, &amp;c. And his Dialogues are full of ſuch friuolous tales: Howſoeuer that Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe not admit into Purgatorie, any faults or ſinnes how ſleight ſo euer, but the paines and puniſhment only, he concludeth notwithſtanding, that there is no way to be followed, but to do well, ſo long as we are here, without truſting to that which may be done afterward. But what manner of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, what ſteadfaſtnes of faith is there in all this? Or rather what hath it but it may giue vs to belieue, that theſe were ſpirits of deceipt, watchfull and painefull in their craft and occupation, euen in perſwading the world to that which might deceiue them? Tertullian ſaith:
<note place="margin">Tertull. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima c. 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe apparitions are but the mockeries and deceits of the euill ſpirit, who carrieth himſelfe priuily vnder the ſhapes of liuing men, or masked and diſguiſed after the manner of men deceaſed, &amp;c. God hath ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, in the parable of the poore and rich man, that Hell is not open for any to come forth, &amp;c. no not to winne credite to Moyſes and the Prophets, &amp;c. To be ſhort, all manner of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation or apparition of ſoules that is without body, is nothing elſe but a deluſion, nothing elſe but witchcraft.</hi> Chryſoſtome after the ſame manner:
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom 29. in Math. &amp; hom. 13. Idem de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaro hom. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The poſſeſſed with Diuels will crie ſometimes vnto thee and ſay; I am the ſoule of ſuch a one, but wilt thou belieue it? No, not ſo</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>for this ſpeech commeth of the fraud and deceipt of the Diuell. It is not the ſoule of any dead perſon that ſpeaketh ſo, but it is the Diuell that counterfeiteth, the deepelier to deceiue and abuſe the people. For of a certaintie the ſoule ſeperated from the body, goeth not vp and down wandring in theſe lower regions: the ſoules of the righteous are in the hand of God; thoſe of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners after this life, are quickly by force carried away: The hiſtorie of Lazarus and the rich man doth proue the ſame vnto vs.</hi> And againe: <hi>Wouldeſt thouſee that the doctrine of the Scriptures and of the Prophets, is of an other manner of weight, then that of the dead which riſe againe: conſider and know, that whoſoeuer the dead partie may be, yet he is a ſeruant; but as for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is the Lord which ſpeaketh in them. And therefore though a dead man reuine and liue againe, though an Angell come downe from heauen, yet let vs principally belieue the Scriptures: For the Author of them is as wel the Lord of the dead as of the liuing, of men and of Angels. And therefore what the Scriptures teach vs moſt clearely, let vs not goe about to learne of the dead, &amp;c.</hi> And there is an Article in the auncient Synodes: <hi>That ſuch viſions, vnder the colour of ſoules, are of the Diuell.</hi> But what then may we thinke that Tertullian or Chryſoſtome would haue ſaid to Gregorie? Verily, that theſe viſions had beene of the Diuell: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and his Purgatorie alſo, a doctrine of Diuels. And againe ſome haue doubted of theſe Dialogues, that they were not his, becauſe that in the reſt of his bookes hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be more graue: And Sabinian his next ſucceſſor, cauſed ſo many of them to be burnt, as he could. But ſome on the contrarie, haue ſought by all the wayes they can, to make them to bee belieued, for the procuring of the greater authoritie to Purgatorie. And by name,
<note place="margin">Anno. 730.</note> Gregorie the thirde cauſed them to bee publiſhed throughout all Chriſtendome, to the ſame ende. Damaſcen,
<note place="margin">Damaſcen confirmeth it.</note> if a man will lend his eare vnto them, hath not ſmally aduaunced this building, but alwayes with the ſelfe ſame Argumentes; for in a certaine prayer which they attribute vnto him,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15548:164"/>S. Steuen by his prayers, ſaueth Falcouilla a Pagan, deceaſed in Idolatrie. God alſo made the head of a certaine Prieſt that was dead, and a Gentile borne (for ſuch a one doth Durandus deſcribe him to bee) to ſpeake to Macarius, and declare to him, the conſolations that they in Purgatorie receiue by the ſuffrages of the liuing. Againe, at the prayer of Gregorie, paſsing through Traian his Countrie, God deliuered Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian out of hell, &amp;c. But I maruaile that they are not aſhamed of theſe fables; or why at the leaſt they ſet them not in better order? Seeing that out of hell there is no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Seeing alſo that, according to their doctrines, the Gentiles cannot be in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie? But it ſeemeth that this pretended Damaſcen, is aſhamed of himſelfe when he concludeth ſaying, that he ſpeaketh not any thing that he meaneth to ſtand vnto; and that what hee ſaith, is but by way of diſcourſe: but ſuch is his diſcourſe, as that they make a Creed of it. And yet it is not credible that this was his prayer; ſeeing that in his Bookes <hi>de Orthodoxa fide,</hi> in which it is his drift to compriſe the Chriſtian faith, he maketh no mention of Purgatorie.
<note place="margin">Anno. 750.</note> Now this fell out about the yeare, 750.</p>
               <p>From this time forward the opinion of the ſacrifice,
<note place="margin">The growth of Purgatorie, through the opinion of a ſacrifice.</note> as alſo that of Purgatorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan mutually &amp; wittingly to lend their hands, the one to the other: ignorance grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth groſſer and groſſer and that ſenſibly and to the ſight of the eye, throughout all Chriſtendome, and in this darkneſſe, the ſpirit of darkneſſe, diſpatcheth and beſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe about his buſines. Once to looke into the Scriptures, was by no meanes to be heard of; but to hearken after myracles, was the whole imployment of the mind. One man had ſeene the ſoules tormented vpon the Gridyron, an other vpon a Spit; this man had ſeene them burning in the fire, that man had eſpied them dipt in the Ice one was hung vp to be dried in the chimney ſmoake; an other to vnderlay the waſhing raine diſtilling and dryuing downe a Gutter; one liuing, but in a traunce, an other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning againe after death. Further more, this man had diſcouered one of the Gulfs in Ireland, an other that in Sicilia; and a third that in Pozzuolo, the one by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and guidance of an Angell, the other by reuelation from the Diuell. And all the bookes of thoſe times are full of ſuch fooleries: other inſtructions then theſe, there was not any currant amongſt the people, namely the Legends, the Lombardicke hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, and ſuch like. In a word, whereas the Fathers had practiſed the remembrance of the dead (as we haue ſeene) for the comfort and conſolation of the liuing, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to turne all to the contrarie: For thoſe ſaid, that they were in Abrahams boſome, in a place of bleſſed and happie reſt, theſe ſaid they were in extreame torments no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differing from thoſe of hel, &amp;c. And in ſtead that thoſe knew how to teach them to die in an aſſurance of eternall life, theſe tooke the way to make them apprehend &amp; conceiue of death, as of the doore opening to an vnauoidable fire, if they redeeme not themſelues from thence by ſuffrages: for now there was no more leaning vnto the mercie of God; God was become a rigorous &amp; mercileſſe tyrant and tormentor, neither was any thing to be looked for from the ſatisfaction of our Lord, for hee had paid no debt but what was anſwerable for the meere faults and tranſgreſsions: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merite of his paſsion, was become vnable to ſatisfie for our demerits, his paines and puniſhment for ours. But, <hi>Aut ſatis faciendum in hac vita</hi> (ſay they) <hi>or Satis patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in altera: Either a man muſt prouide to make ſatisfaction in this life, by doing ſufficiently well, or in the other by ſuffering ſufficiently euill:</hi> So that this is nothing elſe but to ſay, let the ſuffrages of thoſe that liue after vs, ranſome and redeeme vs from our paines. And thereupon a man muſt cauſe great ſtore of Maſſes to bee ſaid for the dead: for them alſo men muſt found yearely feaſts, Obits, Chapels, or Monaſteries. And the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie clauſe of theſe foundations is:
<note place="margin">Anno. 800. Anno. 1000. Anton. l. 15. c. 15. Violater. l. 2. Lombar. hiſt. l. 8. Polyd. l. 6. c. 9.</note>

Toward the yeare 1000. there was a viſion ſet out to be knowne of the people: How that a man guided by an Angell had ſeene a number of Soules diuerſly handled and intreated, ſome lying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gold, ſome vpon Chaffe or ſtraw, ſome in aboundance, ſome in want and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; according as they were helped there by the ſuffrages of their friends, or otherwiſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15548:164"/>neglected and finding no bodie to care for them. Whereupon ſprung a deuotion of ordaining, that vpon ſome certaine day in the yeare there ſhould be generall prayers made for all ſoules: And that is it which is called, <hi>Dies omnium animarum,</hi> the day of the dead; attributed by the moſt to Odilo the fourth Abbot of Clugni, perſwaded by the flames of the mountaine Etna in Sicilia, of the certainty of the tormentes of Purgatorie: But by other ſome to Boniface the fourth, a little after the time of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the great, after the faſhion and imitation of a certaine feaſt of the Romaines ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated yearely in the month of Februarie for the ſoules of the deceaſed; that is, to purchaſe reſt for them by ſacrifices, night praiers, waxe candles,

                  </gap>, <hi>purgatiue,</hi> or <hi>purgatorie.</hi> Now in the meane time it is not to be forgotten, that in the councel of Lyon 1244. it was not receiued, hauing rooted it ſelfe no where elſe but within the Monaſteries of the order of Clugni: as alſo that in the yeare 1524. Cardinall Campegius propounding certaine Canons of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was aſhamed thereof, and ſo omitted in the twentieth Canon, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the number of feaſtes to ſpeake any word of this feaſt which is at this day gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen ſo famous and ſolemne a thing.</p>
               <p>Here notwithſtanding we haue two things to obſerue: The one is, that theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions were not receiued all at one blow in ſo large a meaſure. For in the third Synode of Toledo it is ordained: <hi>That the dead ſhalbe conueighed to the graue with ſinging of Pſalmes onely in hope of the reſurrection.</hi> This was about the yeare 650. And euen at the ſame time when Boniface Archbiſhop of Mentz, was ſent by Pope Gregorie the third to reforme the Churches of Germanie after his faſhion. Hee found not any of theſe offeringes for the dead in the countrie, but hee brought them in there by the commandement of this Gregorie. And this was about the yeare 800.
<note place="margin">Carol. Mag. l. 1 c. 83.</note> And Charles the great to repreſſe theſe beginninges, thought good to limit the ſame: to the end that they might not runne on to the ruine and vndoing of inheritours and other children, that were then but yong: in like manner he ordained to what vſe the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were offered ſhould ſerue, namely two thirds to be giuen to the poore, and one third to the Cleargie.
<note place="margin">Innocent. 3. in Extrauag. de Preſbyt. non baptizato.</note> The decree of Innocent the third is not ſleightly here to be paſſed ouer, of a prieſt vnbaptiſed and yet dying in the faith of Chriſt, whom hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>Caeleſte gaudium incunctanter adeptum, to haue obtained eternall life without delay or ſtay:</hi> ordaining notwithſtanding, that praiers and ſacrifices ſhould be offered vp for him. Where we will note two things: The firſt, that the way to heauen by purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, was not in his iudgement neceſſarie: ſeeing that an vnbaptiſed prieſt had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do there. The ſecond: That the praiers for the dead do not preſuppoſe a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie: ſeeing he ordained them for one whom he belieued &amp; affirmed to bee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in Paradice. And it is not to be ſtood vpon here, that Panormitan ſaith, that hee had obtained it, <hi>Spe, non re; in hope but not in deed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. l. 1. de eccleſ. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. c. 1. &amp; 2</note> For Bellarmine himſelfe alleadgeth this place againſt thoſe which denied, that the faithfull departed did enioy the ſight of God before the day of iudgement. Let vs adde hereunto, that in all the vigiles of the dead, there is not a word mentioned of purgatorie, nor yet of the fire or paines from which the dead are to be releaſed by the diligence and carefulneſſe of thoſe that are aliue: but rather there is ſpeech laying out the miſeries of this life, the merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, repentance and reconciliation with him whiles wee are here by Ieſus Chriſt: the bleſſed life, and the reſurrection of the dead, &amp;c. All of them leſſons of conſolation for ſuch as are liuing, who were accuſtomed after the death of their kinſfolkes, to call the Miniſters of the Church vnto their houſes, to ſpend the night with them in theſe holy meditations: <hi>Playing the Philoſophers</hi> (ſaith Chryſoſt.) <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God:</hi> whereupon they were called vigils, whereas they are ſo called now a daies, though they fall to be kept at high noone.</p>
               <p>The other is,
<note place="margin">Reſiſtances.</note> that theſe ſuperſtitions likewiſe were not receiued without conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for after the ſharpe contentions which were in the Church in the time of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine which wrought this effect, that Purgatorie was left indifferent:
<note place="margin">About the yeare 1200.</note> as time grew
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:15548:165"/>on; God (who neuer leaueth himſelfe without teſtimony vnto the face of the world, that ſo he might make it inexcuſable) raiſed vp ſome to withſtand the ſame in diuers places, and at diuers times. In the Eaſt, the fift generall Councell which quenched and quite put out the fire of Purgatorie in the Eaſt Church, &amp; that almoſt at the ſame time that Gregorie did blow it vp in the Latine, and that after ſo ſure a maner, as that it was neuer able to recouer either heate or light ſince then in thoſe Churches.
<note place="margin">Nilus de purg.</note> And this appeareth by the Apologie put vp by the Greekes in the Councell of Baſill, and by a treatiſe of purgatorie, made by Nilus Archb. of Theſſalonica. And in the Weſt Churches the diſputation held by Claudius Archbiſhop of Turin, in the time of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes the Gentle, againſt the ſuperſtitions of the Church of Rome, and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſame,
<note place="margin">Anno 900.</note> about the yeare 900. The lectures and publike ſermons of Peter de Bruits, and Henrie his ſucceſſor at Tholoſa, who taught for the ſpace of thirtie yeare throughout all Languedoc and Guienne: That Chriſt was not ſacrificed a new vppon the Altar in the Maſſe: That this oblation was not offered for the ſaluation of ſoules: That the Maſſes, praiers, &amp; other works of the liuing for the dead, were vnprofitable, fooliſh,
<note place="margin">Petr Clunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſ. l. 1.</note> &amp; impious. And theſe things we ſhuld not know how to come by, to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the ſame, but that Peter Abbot of Clugni reporteth the ſame vnto vs, who no doubt forgot not to darken and ouerſhadow their doctrine ſo much as lay in him. And it is to be noted, that this Peter was in the end burned aliue: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Henry continued aliue and tooke his place.
<note place="margin">Anno 1100.</note> This was about the yeare 1100. The bookes of Arnoldus Villanouanus, a Spaniard by nation, excellently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the languages, Hebrew, Greeke, Latine &amp; Arabicke, a great Philoſopher and Diuine, in which there is ſet downe amongſt diuers others this generall Propoſition: <hi>That we muſt not either make ſatisfaction or offer any ſacrifice for the dead.</hi> This was about the yeare 1200.
<note place="margin">Anno 1200.</note> At the ſame time the Waldenſes in France taught: <hi>That the true and onely purgatorie was in this life, in the precious blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and not elſewhere: That the Maſses were ſacriledges and not ſacrifices, which rob and ſteale away the honour due vnto the merit of our Sauior, &amp;c.</hi> who after they had maintained their doctrine in many Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes in Languedoc and Guyenne, as appeareth by the very hiſtories of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were in the ende oppreſſed and borne downe by force of armes: the Chriſtian forces leuied againſt the Turkes and Saraſins, being ſet on worke to do this feat. And notwithſtanding they were not ſo wholly extinguiſhed, but that their aſhes ſowen by the prouidence of God throughout all Europe, did afterward ſtifle and choake theſe abuſes of our age throughout the better part of Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>Now when the field might ſeeme to be wholie left waſt and emptie for the Deuill, he contented not himſelf to walke the broad &amp; high way.
<note place="margin">An exceeding great increaſe. Queſtions of Purgatorie.</note> And thereupon taking pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for granted they begun to reaſon in the ſchools: Whether the ſuffrages made for many together haue as much efficacie, as when they are made for one alone: Or els being made for one alone, whether they bee of force for all thoſe that are in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. A certaine Praepoſitiuus anſwered affirmatiuely: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>it is like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle which giueth light vnto many: and as a lecture which teacheth many, and that without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any wrong or iniurie vnto one by helping of another.</hi> The ſchoolemen then and the Monkes foreſeeing that the whole trade and trafficke of Maſſes was loſt and gone, if this reſolution tooke place, doe conſequently muſter and band themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all their might againſt the ſame: They diſpute and argue, that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages are ſpecially of force for them for whom they are made, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: That of two condemned to bee either of them a hundred yeares in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, the one by multitude of ſuffrages may come forth the firſt day: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for lacke of them ſhall there endure and finiſh his appointed tearme.

               </p>
               <p>Another queſtion followeth, whether the ſuffrages made for the dead,
<note place="margin">Other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> by men which haue committed mortall and deadly ſinnes can help them. And herein many were moued to belieue that they could not. Where it is to bee noted, that the laitie were wont vntill now to make theſe ſuffrages by prayers, beades, roſaries, &amp;c. And for this inconuenience they found a verie ſafe conueyance: namely, that all men are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that <hi>Nemo ſine crimine viuit, &amp;c.</hi> And that therefore it was the ſureſt courſe that theſe ſuffrages ſhould be made by the mouth and miniſterie of the prieſtes, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were ſinners, yea and that hainous ſinners as the reſt of other men yet they were not conſidered &amp; accompted of as the lay men, according to their priuate demerites, but as aduocates and dealers for the Church, according to the deſert of the vniuerſall Church. And againe vpon this reſolution great aduantage doeth riſe vnto the Prieſtes, viz. a notable multiplying of Maſſes for the dead. Neither is there in all this any let, but that the Canoniſtes may ſet the wethercockes vpon the higheſt pinacles of this building, brought to his preſent hugeneſſe by another inuention, which is, that there are in hell certaine that are not extreame wicked ones, whoſe paines and torments may be mittigated and much eaſed by ſuch ſuffrages: and this in the end hath brought them beyond any limitable point.

The Gray friers, to the end that they might haue men deuoted to them, begin to preach, that S. Francis deſcended once euery yeare into purgatorie to free and ſet at libertie ſuch as did affect his order: The Iacobines after the manner that is vſed at Portſale, proclaime how that S. Dominicke performeth this worke euerie moneth: The Carmelite, or white friers, that the virgin Marie, for whoſe ſake they looke to be accompted and held for famous and renowned, did the ſame euerie Saturday. The Auguſtines contradicted all the other, ſhewing by the ſcriptures againſt S. Auguſtine himſelfe: That who ſo belieueth in Chriſt commeth not into iudgement, but paſſeth readily from death to life, according to that which the Lord had ſaid to the theefe: <hi>To day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradice.</hi> Thus were Chriſtian ſoules diſtracted and drawne into vncertainties, by theſe varieties, not knowing any longer to whom they ought to acknowledge as due the worke of their ſaluation. And amongſt all the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions then broached, none but that which was true in deed was held for hereſie. So deeply had deceitfull errour rooted it ſelfe, and ſo largely had it ouerſpread the world, being borne vp by the authoritie and power of man.
<note place="margin">Dominc.</note> And yet Frier Dominick <hi>a Soto</hi> durſt ſay within the memory of this age: <hi>That it is not credible, ſeeing that purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie is not for any but the faithfull, that God ſhould leaue his friendes ſo long a time in the fire: and that he thinketh that there is not any one that abideth there twentie yeares.</hi> A great crack in the groundworke and yearely funerall feaſtes of the Church of Rome.

               <p>Now the Churches of Fraunce and Germany haue propounded within theſe 200. yeares many articles to the Popes, which they called <hi>Grauamina,</hi> wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained themſelues grieuouſly of theſe abuſes, which notwithſtanding they haue not regarded to make any redreſſe therein, in as much as the landes and liuinges of the Cleargie reſteth principally vpon this protended fire; a fire as wee haue a little ſeene without any ground or foundation either from the ſcriptures or in the auncient Church. In ſo much as that the Monks began to preach in the beginning of the age
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:15548:166"/>wherein we liue: <hi>That the ſoules which were there did leape at the ſound of the money when it was caſt into the baſen for them: That there was no ſo grieuous or hainous a crime, no ſo great abhomination, no ſo heauie or rigorous puniſhment, from which men were not acquit &amp; freede thereby, &amp;c.</hi> Againſt theſe enormities many great perſons haue beene moued to ring the popes ſuch round and loud peales, as that they haue thereby beene almoſt ſhaked beſides both ſeat and ſea; and therevpon it is, that euerie one of them hath not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, neither doth as yet, to labor and do his vttermoſt endeuour by a thouſand wiles, and as many ſhiftes to neſtle and ſettle himſelfe both ſure and faſt, without retracting or departing from any thing of all that whereof he is become ſeazed and poſſeſſed. So farre is it off, that he ſhould grow aſhamed of any of his iugling trickes and coſenages how open ſoeuer they be laid,
<note place="margin">The doctrine of purgatory, the marke of Antichriſt.</note> to the ſight and view of the world. In this point alſo he beareth a ſpeciall marke and note of Antichriſt: namely, in the ſtealing away of the merite of our redemption, ſo much as in him lyeth, from Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: Howbeit that the Churches of the Abyſſines, Armenians, Muſcouites, and Grecians, do not acknowledge this Purgatorie. For whereas they would make vs belieue, that the Greeke Church doth auouch &amp; allow of the ſame in a Councell held at Florence, in the time of Pope Eugenius,
<note place="margin">Anno 1439.</note> when as the Emperor Paleologus preſſed of the Turke, came for ſuccour and aide to the Princes of the Weſt: it is all in vaine, falſe and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, ſeeing that the Biſhop of Epheſus principall deputed, did proteſt and openly diſclaime the ſame, before the whole Councell aſſembled: and for that the Greeke Churches diſauowed that which had beene done by the others, whom they affirmed to be manifeſtly wonne by the Pope, as in deed part of them did continue and abide with him. And thus we haue no Purgatorie, and by conſequent no Maſſes or ſacrifices for the dead: Purgatorie in his fall drawing the Maſſe after it into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoidable ouerthrow, according to our aduerſaries their owne doctrine.

                  <note place="margin">That the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the old Teſtament neuer ſought for helpe or ſuccour by praier, but at the hands of the one onely God. Eckius in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chird.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore we ſee proportionablie to this doctrine, that the fathers of the old Teſtament did neuer offer vp or direct their prayers vnto any but to one God alone. And this our aduerſaries ſubſcribe vnto: for ſo alſo was it held for a point of ſound diuinitie amongſt them, that ſeeking of helpe at God by prayer was a part of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and worſhip due vnto himſelfe alone. They ſay, that this was for feare that the people, who otherwiſe were readie and apt enough of themſelues therevnto, ſhould turne aſide vnto idolatrie: but this is to geſſe and not to anſwere. But at the leaſt they confeſſe, that this is the way to ſlippe into idolatrie. The reſt ſay, That the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prayed not vnto the Patriarkes and Prophetes, becauſe they were as yet in the Limbes: But this is a thing to bee diſputed and debated by vs, if here were any place. But at the leaſt there were Angels, and thoſe oftentimes conuerſing and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping companie with men, and hauing therewithall the charge of countries and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Henoch and Elias alſo had beene rapt and caried aliue vp into heauen, and the latter of them in the ſight of Elizeus. And yet notwithſtanding we do not reade that any people or particular man in ſo many ages did euer pray vnto any Angel, or made choiſe of any to make interceſſion to God for him. No more then euer Noe or his Sonnes did to Enoch, or Eliſeus to Elias: the ſonnes to the father, or the diſciples to their maiſter: albeit (as we know) Eliſeus were zealouſly affected to Elias: <hi>My father, the chariot and horſemen of Iſrael.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the new Teſtament God alone is prayed vnto.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the new Teſtament likewiſe as little; notwithſtanding that they hold, That the fathers by the deſcending of Chriſt into hell, were deliuered out of the limbes, and caried vppe into heauen. Fit matter for the children of Abraham, the father of the faithfull, to flie vnto him, to call vpon him for aide and ſuccour, and ſo of the reſt. Notwithſtanding alſo that many of the Apoſtles and diſciples ſuffered preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our Lord, as Iames, Steuen, &amp;c. during the life time of Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and Saint Iohn. Matter ſufficient to ſerue that it ſhould not bee kept cloſe from vs, that beſides Ieſus Chriſt wee haue them for our aduocates with God: and for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors by vertue of their ſufferinges and merites. And the ſame may bee ſaid of the holy virgine, whome Saint Iohn ouerliued many yeares, the aduocate at this day (if wee will belieue them) of the Church of Rome: who at the leaſt ſhould haue beene excepted from theſe generall rules. And here againe they ſay, that the Apoſtles fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that this might be held for arrogancie in them. And why on the behalfe of the Saintes of the old Teſtament, and of the holy virgine? Againe, That they ſtoode in doubt leaſt the Gentils ſhould returne againe to their idols. But that there might not ſo many duties of deuotion be loſt and let ſlip, could they not make ſome maner of diſpatch or diſpenſation? could they not deuiſe ſome way to cure and remedie the ſame? And would they that theſe babiſh excuſes ſhould paſſe for currant reaſons
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:15548:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>with vs, and that againſt ſo expreſſe textes of the ſcripture?</p>
               <p>What then ſay they, doe you make no more accompt of the ſaints, of thoſe which haue ſuffered here on earth for the name of Chriſt, and which now are aſcended tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly with him vp on high, &amp;c?
<note place="margin">The honour that is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints. 1. Cor. 12. Gal. 2. 2 Cor. 3. Act 9. &amp; 14.

And afterward wee praiſe and magnifie themſelues, in the gifts which it hath pleaſed God to diſtribute vnto them of his grace and fauour: and ſpecially that hee hath ſhewed them this fauour to vſe them for the ſetting forth of his glory:
<note place="margin">Math 25. Heb. 3.</note> for that hauing well imployed their talentes giuen them of the Lord they are entered into his ioy: for that they haue beene faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the houſe, ſo that they haue not loued or ſpared their owne liues,

And all this according to the precepts &amp; examples which we haue in the ſcriptures wherein their liues &amp; their deathes haue beene ſet out vnto vs to thoſe endes: whereas our aduerſaries haue made them ridiculous by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and faigned legendes, and ſtill doe make the name of Chriſt in ſtead of being glorified, to be blaſphemed by theſe their fooleries which they deliuer to the poore people for their principall inſtructions: whereas for fiue hundred yeares after our Lorde they were condemned to be falſe,

               <p>But rather wee denie with the ſcriptures, that we ought either to flie vnto them for ſuccour, or els worſhip them: For theſe ſeruices are due vnto God alone: and to take them as interceſſors betwixt God and vs, is not belonging to them, it is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our onely Mediator Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: Neither yet ought we to make any imployment of their merites, or workes of ſupererrogation, eyther to appeaſe the wrath of God, or to ſupply our vnworthineſſe, or elſe the paſſion of our Lorde: for this were to annihilate, and make of no effect his perfect ſacrifice. And this is that which wee haue to condemne in the Maſſe in this place: wherein the Prieſt contrarie to that which hath beene tolde vs ſo oft, namely, that God is the onely ſearcher of heartes, doth confeſſe his ſinnes to the Angelles, to the virgine Marie, to the Saintes and Sainteſſes, and prayeth them to bee interceſſors for him vnto God: wherein hee prayeth God to pardon his ſinnes, not by the merite of Chriſt, nor by his blood, but by the merite of all the Saintes, and ſpecially, <hi>Of thoſe whoſe relickes are vnder the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> And wherein the ſacrifice, as they pretend of Chriſt, is offered to God in the honour of the virgine Marie, and of the men ſaintes, and women ſaintes, &amp;c. And theſe thinges we affirme to be directly againſt the word of God, againſt the analogie of faith, and againſt the vnitie of the auncient Church.

And as for that which is ſaid of the name of Abraham being called vpon by his children, it is a common and accuſtomed ſpeech of the Hebrews, vſed when they will ſpeake of thoſe men or women which are ingrafted into a familie:
<note place="margin">Eſay, 4.</note> as in Eſay, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen women deſire of one man, that his name may bee called vppon by them; that is to ſay, that they may bee called by his name, or held for his, &amp;c. And in this place is plainly deliuered the adopting of the two ſonnes of Ioſeph, which Iacob reputeth and holdeth to bee by place and right as capable of inheritance in the parting of the land as his owne ſonnes: as in deed they drew lots for two. But and if they belieue not vs, yet let them at the leaſt belieue their owne writers.

Let them alſo remember themſelues of their owne doctrine; How that the fathers were in the Limbes, that in the Limbes they did not ſee God, neither by conſequent know the affaires of men: whereupon it followeth by their owne ſayings, that they could not be called vpon.

Otherwiſe if they will vrge it, as vnderſtood of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then I woulde haue them once againe to remember and thinke vppon their Limbe.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame nature is that which followeth in Ezechiel:
<note place="margin">Ezech. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue ſought a man</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that ſhould make vp the hedge, and ſtand in the gappe againſt me for this land, to the end I might not deſtroy it; but J haue not found him:</hi> that is, as it is ſaide of Dauid, a man according to mine owne heart, which might ſtand betwixt mine anger and this people: as Abraham for Sodome, and Moyſes for Iſrael. Saint Ierome: <hi>I haue ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for a man amongst them, which could reſiſt and withſtand mine anger, as Moyſes, Aaron and Samuel.</hi> Note by the way theſe wordes, <hi>from amongst them.</hi> And yet Theodoret dealeth more plainly, who expoundeth it by the place of Ieremie aboue expounded, c. 5. <hi>Looke about you in your places, and ſee if there bee any that executeth iudgement, and ſeeketh after faith, &amp;c. and I will be fauourable vnto him, that is to ſay,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>amongst your princes, your priests, &amp;c.</hi> But what is there in all this that hath any thing to doe with the inuocation of Saints deceaſed.</p>
               <p>For want of matter and proofe in the Canonicall ſcriptures,
<note place="margin">2.

And as for the ſtrength of this argument wee ſhall better examine the ſame elſewhere: but the ſtorie is; That Iudas to incourage his ſoldiers, being vppon the point of entering into a great fight, acquainted them with this viſion that had appeared vnto him. But either it was a reall action, or a likeneſſe and repreſentation onely. If it were reall and in deed, where is then their Limbes become? For they all agree, that in the Limbes they can make no interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither be inuocated.

<note place="margin">Gloſſ. in 2. Machab. c. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That in Onias is repreſented the order of the priesthood: and in Ieremias the Propheticall order: and in the one and the other Ieſus Chriſt the high prieſt and Prophet, of whom Moyſes hath ſaid: I will raiſe vp vnto you a Prophet like vnto mee: of whom S.

Now the verſe going before ſeemeth to make for the latter: <hi>For</hi> (it ſaith) <hi>we periſh &amp; are deſtroied for euer.</hi> But let vs take it according to their own ſence. Lyranus giueth them the repulſe &amp; ouerthrow: <hi>He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the praiers which the Patriarkes &amp; the Prophets had made whiles they liued,

               <p>But what agreement hath this praier and interceſsion of the liuing Saints with that of the dead? Thoſe being commanded, with promiſe to be heard; theſe not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, but ſubiect vnto that great Woe ſo oftentimes repeated: <hi>Woe to them which adde therunto.</hi> Saint Paul prayeth for them that were in the ſame Shippe: he praieth alſo the Romaines to pray for him. But did he allow them to call vpon, or to pray for aide vnto him; or did hee himſelfe inuocate the Romaines. And therefore if we from theſe mutuall praiers of the faithfull that are liuing, riſe vp to the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints that are dead, what ſhall let vs then, but that from the inuocation of the dead, wee ſhall deſcend by conſequent to the inuocating and adoring of thoſe that be aliue, to make vowes and offer vp our oblations vnto them, to erect and build Churches and Altars in honour of them; to burne ſacrifices and incenſe vnto them, and finally to reuiue the whole Maſſe of Paganiſme, for them which are as yet vppon earth, as wee haue alreadie done for them which are in heauen?

And ſtill they forget, that this dutie, could not be exerciſed in the Limbes. Wheras the text is plaine enough to thoſe that haue any eyes. Moyſes, that is to ſay, the lawe and doctrine of Moſes doth accuſe vs, is the ſentence of condemnation againſt vs, when we infringe and breake it, when we reiect and caſt of that which it offereth vs: and particularly it condemneth the Phariſies, for that they denie Chriſt promiſed in the law.

And this praier, without any further geſsing of it doth follow in the next verſe: <hi>Thou art worthie to take the booke and to open the Seales thereof, &amp;c. for thou haſt bought and purchaſed vs to God by thy bloud, out of euerie tribe and language, &amp;c.</hi> And then, not to imploy their merits with God for vs, in ſtead of that of the Lambe: but rather to acknowledge the bloud of the Lambe; imployed for themſelues.

<note place="margin">Apocal. 8.3.</note> which they further alleadge out of the fore part of the eight Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the Angell ſtandeth before the Altar, with a Cenſor of gold; wherein there were many perfumes giuen vnto him, either to offer vp with the praiers of all the Saints; or rather according to the Greeke, to adde it to the praiers of the Saints, vpon the Altar of gold which is before the throne.

               <p>If this were not, that wee haue to adde thereto the blaſphemie of the Archbiſhop Antonine: <hi>Let vs drawe neere,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle vnto the Hebrewes, <hi>vnto the throne of grace, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay of the Virgine Marie which is the throne of Chriſt, wherein he hath reſted: <hi>to the end wee may obtaine mercie, and find grace for the obtaining of helpe in due time, &amp;c.</hi> Which is manifeſtly ſpoken of Ieſus Chriſt our Biſhop. And therefore it is no maruaile though Eckius doe freely and boldly ſay: That the holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">Eckius in Ench</note> hath not appointed or ordained by the expreſſe Scriptures, the inuocation of Saints, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the old or new Teſtament. And Petrus a Soto: That it is not manifeſtly taught there; but onely inſinuated, and the Ieſuites themſelues, that it is not clearely giuen vs there, but as in a myſterie, and by a certaine conſequence. And on the contrarie a great maruaile, that a doctrine amongſt them of ſuch moment, ſhould not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures, but by the way of a lame and pretended conſequence. As in deed the Councell of Trent hath not found it in the Scripture, but in auncient vſe and cuſtome, in the conſent of the Fathers, and in the Decrees of the Councels. Which we will examine hereafter.</p>
               <p>A third point remaineth;
<note place="margin">That the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Saints, hath no ground in the Scripture.</note> that they are as weakly and ſlenderly grounded in the Maſſe, for the offering vp of the merits and paſsions of the Saints vnto God, for the ſatisfying of their ſinnes, in ſtead of the infinite merite, of that one onely ſacrifice, that the Sonne of God hath offered vpon the Croſſe: whether we conſider the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:15548:172"/>of that only one, or the inſufficiencie of all the reſt, how many and whatſoeuer they be. The ſufficiencie, for it is the Sonne of God, eternal and infinite; the ſacrificer and the ſacrifice, whoſe ſacrifice hath by conſequent, an infinite and eternall efficacie; as the Apoſtle doth largely handle the ſame in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes. The inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of al other, becauſe that they are the works of the creatures, &amp; by conſequent finite and imperfect: and of men, and by conſequent ſubiect to ſinne and ſinners, and thoſe the moſt, who preſume not to bee at all: according to that which is ſaid vnto vs in S. Iohn: <hi>Jf we ſay</hi> (he putteth himſelfe in the number) <hi>that we haue no ſinne we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs.</hi> That then, that all the Saints haue not beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; it was in the mercie of God by Ieſus Chriſt, the holy Virgine her ſelfe, whom hee hath vouchſafed to regard in her baſe and low eſtate; being ſo much the more bound, by how much the more ſhee hath receiued, and ſo much the further off from meriting, by how much the more it hath pleaſed him the Almightie and ſoueraigne Lord (if it be lawfull ſo to ſpeake) to merite at her hands. That they are raigning in heauen, a botomleſſe depth of his goodneſſe, an inheritance of the children, and not any pledge or badge of ſeruants, in as much as in his welbeloued ſonne it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, according to the riches of his grace, of vnprofitable and peruerſe ſeruants to adopt them Sons, yea, coheires with his Chriſt: according to that which is ſaid in ſo many places:
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>You are ſaued by grace, by faith in Chriſt, and not of your ſelues: For this is the gift of God, not by workes, to the end that no man may boaſt.</hi> Againe, <hi>We are iuſtified by grace, that we may bee his heires,
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> in hope of eternall life.</hi> And of grace: <hi>For we are all conceiued in originall ſinnes.</hi> And all the water of humane merits, cannot waſh them away; though they ſhould amount vnto the meaſure of a mightie floud: it muſt of neceſsitie bee the worke of the bloud of Chriſt, waſhed likewiſe by that bloud, yet the remnants of that naturall corruption, doe continually abide and dwell with vs; that ſo we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his grace in our infirmitie: whereas our firſt father loſt the ſame by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended incorruption and impoſsibilitie for his nature to ſinne. And therefore wee haue to ſay with Dauid: <hi>If thou enter into iudgement with thy ſeruant who may abide it?</hi> With Salomon:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 143. Eccleſiaſt. 6. Iob. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>There is not a righteous man vpon the earth that doth good, nay, which doth not ſinne.</hi> With Iob: <hi>The heauens are not pure in his ſight, no not the Angels: how much leſſe man, vnprofitable and abheminable; which drinketh iniquitie like water?</hi> Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth likewiſe, that if God ſhould haue giuen vnto man, euen him that is the holieſt of all the reſt, a thouſand Paradiſes, (if it could bee done) for an inheritance, yet ſo graceleſſe he is, as that he ſhould not be able to keepe one of them, without his grace, for quickly would hee looſe them, by reaſon of his ſinnes and tranſgreſsions, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſeueritie of his iuſtice taking the balance once in hand. And how ſhould he purchaſe it then by his own power? And yet further how ſhuld he leaue a remainder, to be husbanded for others? Some ſay, if they haue loſt them by their falles, as Saint Peter by hauing denied Chriſt, and S. Paul by perſecuting of his Church; yet they haue recouered them, by the confeſsion and Martyrdome, which they haue made and ſuffered for his name, and that ſo aboundantly, as that they haue left an ouerplus. But O horrible blaſphemie.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. l. 30.</note> S. Paul and S. Peter ſay not ſo: They doe not glorie in any thing, but in the Croſſe of Chriſt, but in his ſufferings, but in his ſtripes, not in their owne righteouſneſſe, not in their owne holineſſe, but in him which was vnto them from God, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, redemption, &amp;c. So farre off are they from being of that mind, that in reſpect of them, he hath ſuffered in vaine.

<note place="margin">The conſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain places wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied.</note> as conſequently following vpon the ſame; and theſe are now to be examined of vs. For ſay they, thoſe which liue here pray vnto God one for an other, and doe vſe the praiers one of an other vnto God; wherefore ſhould ſuch as liue in heauen aboue, leſſe performe the ſame for ſuch as are liuing heere below; and thoſe below, make leſſe vſe of ſuch as are abiding on high? The oddes and difference betwixt the one and the other doe furniſh vs with ſtore of anſweres. And firſt; we haue an expreſſe commaundement, to pray one for an other here below, and a promiſe accompanying the commaundement, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a bleſsing, when theſe our praiers are made in faith. Which falleth out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, in the matters of pietie and ſeruice of God, exerciſed without any foundation in his word; for ſo it falleth out to bee an vncertaine worke: and therefore without faith, and therefore alſo ſinne, and by conſequent, diſpleaſing vnto God. Secondly, we belieue that the Saints in heauen are inflamed with charitie towards the Church, neither do doubt of their hartie deſire of the good of the ſame, as vnto the bodie, for the glorie of God, and to euerie particular, as they are members of the ſame, for their ſaluation. And to proceed thus farre, is not beyond the bonds of pietie, ſo that a man learne to ſtay himſelf there. But we denie that they either ſee our neceſsities, or heare our ſutes and complaints: affirming that this ſhould make them like vnto God, the onely ſearcher of hearts; and our aduerſaries themſelues dare not ſay it. They anſwere that they ſee our thoughts, not as they are in our ſpirits, but in God. And we anſwere them, that this is a deuiſed fantaſie without any foundation: and that the created ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not pearce or enter into the ſpirit not created, but on the contrarie, that if it were otherwiſe, that then the Angels ſhould know all things in God, as wel the things to come, as thoſe that are preſent, ſeeing that with him euerie thing is preſent: Now there are many things vnknowne vnto them; for the myſterie of our ſaluation was hid from them before: and now at this day, they are ſtill ignorant when the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall bee,

God promiſeth to Ioſias, that he ſhould die before, to the end that his eyes might not ſee the euils: the ſpirits then of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are in aplace, where they ſee not what is done in this life, &amp;c.</hi> Adde thereunto, that the greater part of the other fathers, as we haue ſeene before, haue taught: that the Saints at their departure out of this life, doe not inioy the ſight of God, but are in a place of reſt expecting and waiting for the reſurrection, that ſo they may receiue the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their glorie. Now thoſe which held this opinion, could not approoue the reaſon which our Aduerſaries alleadge for the inuocation of Saints, that is, that their ſoules and ſpirits doe ſee euerie thing in God: nor by conſequent this inuocation, if ſo bee it doe depend and follow thereupon. Saint Paul ſaith,

               <p>But where the word of God faileth them, they forge humane reaſons,
<note place="margin">A confutation of their human reaſons.</note> and thoſe a great deale more vnmeete to bee admitted in Diuinitie; as that which intreateth of God; then thoſe of the Ciuill Law, to bee admitted in Phyſicke; or on the contrarie, becauſe alſo that, that in hauing an infinite ſubiect, which is not knowne, otherwiſe then as it pleaſeth him to vouchſafe to reueale himſelfe, is infinitely and beyond all proportion, exceeding all others. In the Courts of great Princes, ſay they, there is not any man that goeth directly to the King: hee hath need to make waie for the ſame, by the fauour and mediation of ſome great Lord, who is imployed neere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his perſon. And not without cauſe ſay wee, becauſe that the Prince is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſdainfull, and ſometimes ſhunneth, and ſeeketh to auoide occaſions of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes.</p>
               <p>But in God which is altogether infinite, what place or reaſon can this reaſon haue: whoſe power and wiſedome cannot be ouercharged with the managing of the whole vniuerſall world; whoſe goodneſſe reacheth and extendeth moſt liberally and freely, euen vnto the leaſt and ſmalleſt things: nay rather, who ſtandeth more readie and willing, asſaith the Pſalmiſt, more neere vnto the afflicted heart, and more readie continually to heare vs, then wee are to call vppon him, infinitely more readie to bow and ſtoupe vnto vs in his bountifull kindneſſe, then wee are to ariſe and lift vp our ſelues vnto him in our praiers? Nay, ſaith he, O fraile and vaine man that thou art,

Subiects haue acceſſe vto the king. But I beſeech you, is there any man ſo fooliſh, and ſo rechleſſe of his owne preſeruation, as that he will giue that honour vnto any ſuch Earle, which is due vnto the King, ſeeing that to intreat ſuch a man onely, is a point of treaſon? And theſe men, ſhall not they thinke themſelues guiltie of hauing tranſgreſſed, who giue to the creature the honour due to God alone, and which forſake him, to adore and pray vnto their companions, with ſeruice as though beſides that, there were nothing reſerued for God? For verily, in that men make way to haue acceſſe to Kings by Tribunes or Earles, it is becauſe the King is a man, and knoweth not to whome to trust in matters concerning the Common-wealth. But to make God readie and fauourably inclined vnto him, from whom nothing is hid, who knoweth what euerie man wanteth and wiſheth, a man needeth no other ſupporter or mediator, then a deuout ſpirit: for in what place ſoeuer he would ſpeake with him, hee is readie there to giue him an aunſwere.</hi> Origen likewiſe hath aunſwered the verie ſame to Celſus,

And Chryſoſtome, who is nothing behind in ſpeaking for the practiſe of Chriſtians, ſheweth vs, that we may by as good right, vſe the ſame anſwere againſt our aduerſaries. <hi>Tell me woman,</hi> ſpeaking of the Cananite: <hi>Who hath made thee ſo bold, (wicked and ſinfull wretch that thou art) to approach and come ſo neere vnto the Lord?

Of a certaintie ſaith hee in the verie ſame Homely: <hi>Becauſe that hee vnderſtandeth in what place ſo euer thou art, in what place ſo euer thou calleſt vpon him: Thou needeſt not any, either porter or mediator, neither yet any one of the family to bring thee in: thou needeſt not, but onely to ſay, Lord haue mercie vpon me, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>When we haue any matter to obtaine at mans hand, wee ſeeke the fauour and helpe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers.

               </p>
               <p>But ſay they, God dooth better accept of thoſe praiers that are made vnto him in humilitie: and doth not this appeare more fully and manifeſtly in them that ſeeke to haue acceſſe vnto him by the Saints, then in thoſe that dare bee ſo bold, as to goe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to him? But in deede the greateſt point of humilitie is obedience, which the Lord loueth better then ſacrifice: And this is alſo mans humilitie, to confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe loſt in himſelfe, and in all the nature of man: and contrarily, pride to ſeeke in himſelfe, or in any other man whatſoeuer, that which cannot be found but in God onely. By this note of proofe and tryall did the Lord himſelfe iudge the Phariſie to bee proud, namely in alleadging mens workes: and the Publicane humble, who durſt not lift vp his eyes vnto heauen, and yet notwithſtanding ſaid confidently:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:15548:174"/>
                  <hi>God bee mercifull vnto me a ſinner:</hi> and this man hee iuſtified, but not the other: <hi>For whoſoeuer</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doth exalt himſelfe, ſhall bee brought low; and hee that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall bee exalted.</hi> And this therefore is humilitie in our praiers, to renounce and forſake al our owne natures, and to betake and lift vp our ſelues to God. And beware thou blaſpheme not hereafter the manner of ſome: that Chriſt is more rigorous and more hard; but the Saints more milde and fauourable: Nay ſaith he, to all the Saints:

Verily, euen as all other humane inuentions, by many ſteps, and by tract of time after many ages. Day by day errour was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whiles men pleaſed themſelues in their inuentions: whereas know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould haue abounded, if they had kept themſelues to the word of Chriſt. Many ages paſſed and were expired, without any inuocation of Saints: ſeeing it ſlipt in amongſt the multitude of Gentiles, in ſuch maner as that no man regarded the ſame to marke and obſerue it in the beginning: and it hath cauſed ſome to wonder exceedingly, how it ſhould already be come to haue a party ſo throghly wonne vnto it amongſt the people, by the blunt &amp; blind aide of the ouertaken with foreſtalled em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Paganiſme; ſeing the moſt ſincere &amp; vncorrupted Doctors, did their whole indeuor to driue it out. But this ſhal be made to appeare more clearely in the handling of the maner of the growth &amp; proceeding thereof; howbeit for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſame, we muſt here ſet before our eyes, how they practiſe this article at this day, in the Church of Rome; in Inuocation, Adoration, Pilgrimages, Temples, Altars, Sacrifices, and in all the reſt of the duties, ſeruices &amp; honours, that belong vnto God,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:15548:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>and are not to be giuen vnto any other, and how they would gladly couer and colour the ſame vnder the ſhadow of ſome Apoſtrophe or Proſopopie framed and applied vnto ſome Saint; or of ſome Panegyricke, deuiſed in the honour of ſome Martyr, or from ſome priuate opinion, left free and indifferent, not of the Church onely, but of euerie Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>As for the holy Scriptures, wee haue ſeene that it hath no foundation in them: on the contrarie, that part or portion therin which ſpeaketh ſo honourably of the Saints whether liuing or dead; of Angels likewiſe &amp; of their miniſterie which they performe, for our ſaluation commeth ſhort,

               <p>It would be too long and tedious a thing here to recite all thoſe places of the firſt Fathers, prouing the inuocation of one onely God, by one onely Ieſus Chriſt: beſides that in the praiers of the Chriſtian Church,

But how far did this honour extend? They were buried with great regard; and there is made yearely a reherſall of their martyrdome, vppon a certaine day: the day of their death is celebrated and ſolemnized by the name of the

               <p>To that aboue ſaid, they oppoſe and bring a place of Ireneus,
<note place="margin">Obiections;</note> where there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon made betwixt Eue and the Virgine Marie. <hi>As Eue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was ſeduced by the words of an Angell, that is a wicked Angell, to runne from God by tranſgreſsing of his word: ſo the Virgine Marie receiued ioyfull tidings, by the word of an Angell, that is a good Angell, to heare God by obeying vnto his word. And as the firſt was ſeduced, and drawne away to runne and flie from God: ſo the ſecond was perſwaded to obey him; to the end that of the Virgine Eue, the Virgin Mary fieret aduocata, might become ſay they, the aduocate.</hi> Here ſaith Belarmine, what can be more cleare? Yea rather ſay we vnto him, what can be more obſcure? That the Virgine Marie ſhould be Eue her aduocate with God, being borne 4000. yeares after Eue, and receiued likewiſe a long time after her into heauen? when as likewiſe we ſhall haue regard to their opinion of the Limbes? But in deed that which goeth before, as alſo that which followeth, ſheweth clearely that Ireneus had no other drift, but to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the good that came to mankind by the meanes &amp; miniſterie of Marie, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie and miſchiefe wherwith the ſame became infected, by that tranſgreſsion of Eue. And as for the word <hi>Aduocate,</hi> ſome are of iudgement, that Ireneus was tranſlated out of Greeke into Latine: for we haue great peeces of him as yet in Greeke, and further it cannot poſsibly bee, that euer any Latine writer would haue written in ſuch a ſtile.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. &amp; paſsim, Ioh. 16</note> And in other places alſo, hee is verie abſurdly tranſlated by his interpreter. Now the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that in the Greeke, one and the ſame word dooth ſignifie both an aduocate and a comforter, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and one and the ſame Verbe to comfort
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:15548:176"/>and to exhort; as is often and commonly to be ſeene in the Scriptures. So in S. Iohn, that which is tranſlated in the Goſpell, <hi>Comforter,</hi> according to the old tranſlation, ſpeaking of the holy Ghoſt, the comforter of our ſoules, is interpreted <hi>Aduocate</hi> in the Epiſtle of S. Iohn,
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.11. Tertul. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. c. 29.</note> ſpeaking of Chriſt the mediatour. Likewiſe Tertullian, where he ſpeaketh of the holy Ghoſt, tranſlateth it <hi>Aduocatum:</hi> ſo indifferently hath it beene taken either for the one or for the other. And ſo the ſence is as if Ireneus ſhould ſay, that as Eue was the ruine and ouerthrow of mankind, ſo the Virgine Marie was for his comfort and conſolation, yea and that amongſt the reſt vnto Eue her ſelfe which had ſinned, in as much as God had choſen this veſſell to beare and bring forth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of mankind, from the firſt man, euen to the laſt.</p>
               <p>They abuſe in a higher degree of vnfaithfull dealing a place in Iuſtinus Martyr.
<note place="margin">Iuſtin. Martyr. Apol 2.</note> The Gentiles reproach the Chriſtians, ſaying that they were Atheiſts, that is to ſay, without God. The Chriſtians anſwere: <hi>Yea without Gods, whom you take to be Gods, but not without the true God. For as concerning him we worſhip him, that is the father and the Son, which is of him, (who is come and hath taught vs theſe things, and all the hoſt of good Angels that follow him) and the propheticall ſpirit:</hi> that is to ſay, we worſhip the father, the ſonne and the holy Ghoſt.

And by this meanes, to ſaue the Saints, they make no conſcience to blaſpheme the holy Ghoſt. But in the meane time this is the Monke Perion his tranſlation: and from thence this errour hath beene diſperſed into many bookes in theſe daies.</p>
               <p>Origen commeth,
<note place="margin">About the yeare, 260. Hieronym. ad Pammach. &amp; Ocean. Epiphan. t. 2. l. 1. haereſ. 63.</note> hauing a bold ſpirit. <hi>Whome I loue</hi> (ſaith S.

After this then to whome may he not iuſtly be ſuſpected? For as heretofore he laid the foundations of Purgatorie, vpon the opinions of the Platoniſts: ſo from the ſame he gathereth the firſt ſtone, wherupon afterward was laid the inuocation of Saints. The Platoniſts ſaid, that the vpper and higher things muſt bee ioyned with the inferiour and lower by a middle comming betwixt both; God with men by Angels, that is, by their mediation and comming betwixt. But Chriſtians muſt not lend their eares to this, as thoſe that haue a far deeper ſecret and myſterie reuealed vnto them, hauing giuen them his Son, God and man, and ioyned together in one perſon, for the ſaluation of mankind, that which was farre remooued and ſet aſunder by our ſinnes, ſo that the Platoniſts could not comprehend or conceiue the ſame. Notwithſtanding wee ſee that mans inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do commonly pleaſe vs better, then the reuelations of God, and fleſh and bloud doth more freely and willingly imbrace them; becauſe it ſmelleth and findeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it owne therein.

That for this cauſe, we muſt praie vnto and honour them; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Aduocates; partly, as more excellent in their merits then men: And that ſuch alſo do the ſame, who for their merits, (being men whiles they were here vpon earth) haue beene exalted and extolled as Gods in heauen; ſuch a one was Aeſculapius, who wrought the ſame effects in heauen by his Diuinitie, which he wrought here below by his Art: ſuch a one alſo was Hermes which ſuccoured and conſerued, generally all thoſe, who directed their praiers vnto him, &amp;c.

Vpon Ioſue: <hi>Ego ſic arbitror; I am mightilie drawne to be perſwaded, that all the fathers which haue fallen aſleepe before vs, doe ſtill in part beare ſome portion of the combat with vs, and doe helpe vs with their praiers: &amp; thus much I haue heard ſaid of ſome of our old maiſters.</hi> Vpon the booke of Numbers he groweth more hot: for ſaith he, <hi>Quis enim dubitat, who doubteth but that they helpe vs with their praiers, and confirme vs by their examples? &amp;c.</hi> Where it is to bee conſidered, how that he ſpeaketh doubtfully of this opinion, &amp; that he which had the ſcriptures at his fingers ends, if hee had had in ſtore euer a place to haue confirmed and ſetled it vpon, he would neuer haue had recourſe to an Apocrypha place of the ſecond booke of Machabees, neither to the report of his old maiſters. But yet moreouer it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by Origen himſelfe, that this was but a diſcourſe of his: and not the faith of his time: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Saintes that haue left this bodie, and are with Chriſt, do any thing for vs after the manner of Angels, that take charge of our ſafetie: let it be accompted amongſt the ſecrets that are hidden and kept cloſe by God, and are not to be intermedled withall by any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that is to ſay in a word, inter Apocrypha:</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But of this priuate diſcourſe of this pretended ſecret miſterie, that the Saints pray for the faithfull, gathereth he this conſequent: it is meete and conuenient therefore, that Chriſtians doe pray vnto them.

And the drift of the diſputation required, that if he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued any ſuch thing, that he ſhould haue added: <hi>To whome God is well pleaſed, that men ſhould make their vowes and praiers, and not to your Gods.</hi> But what ſaith he? <hi>We offer,</hi> ſaith hee (and ſpeaketh no more there as hee was Origen, but as a Syndicke of the Church of his time) <hi>in all humilitie our vowes vnto God, who ſitteth as chiefe Iudge and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour ouer all, by his one onely Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, in whom we put vp our ſupplications, in as much as he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and that as a high prieſt, hee offereth our praiers vnto God, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he afterward) <hi>muſt alone be worſhipped, and the word his one onely Sonne and firſt borne of euerie creature, muſt be alone praied vnto, as the head and chiefe, to the end that he may commend vnto God our praiers which ſhalbe come vnto him, &amp;c.

For is it not better</hi> (addeth hee) <hi>to commit ones ſelfe, and to truſt to God, which ruleth ouer all thinges, which bringeth this doctrine vnto vs by Ieſus Chriſt, and to aske of him ſuch aſſiſtance and protection as may bee miniſtred vnto vs, both from Saintes and Angels? &amp;c.</hi> But if Celſus or rather our aduerſaries taught by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:15548:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>Celſus, ſhould replie vpon him: But doth it not well to haue friendes in the Court?

And as the ſhadow doth follow the mouing of the bodie: ſo in like manner doe all the inferiors attend and waite vppon him which is the ſuperior. For who ſo hath God his friend, hath alſo by conſequent all thoſe friendly to him, that are Gods friendes, whether they bee Saintes or Angels, which without being praied vnto, do pray with him, and for him, and aſsiſt him euery manner of way that they are able, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And herewithall as when the Canonical ſcriptures do faile them, they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue recourſe vnto the Apocrypha: ſo likewiſe the true books of Origen, not contenting or ſatiſfying them, they betake themſelues to ſuch as are falſely attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him. Origen (ſay they) praied vnto the Saints: <hi>You Saints of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I pray you that you would proſtrate your ſelues before the ſeat of Gods mercie, for me a miſerable wretch.</hi> But herewithall I could haue wiſht them not to haue concealed, how that this booke called the lamentations,
<note place="margin">Gelaſ. Decret. 15.</note> or penitential worke of Origen, are declared by pope Gelaſius to be counterfeit &amp; fained. Vpon Iob likewiſe they ſay, that he ſaith, <hi>O Saint Iob pray for vs miſerable ſinners, to the end that the mercy of God may deliuer vs, &amp;c.</hi> But it were to be wiſhed that they had the ſhame to bluſh, for fathering this ſhamefull thing vpon Origen, for attributing to him this whole booke, which is not his in the leaſt tittle thereof, being ſtained with Arrianiſme, and that in ſuch deep &amp; horrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it calleth the holy Trinitie, a ſect, an hereſie, &amp; infidelitie, the three perſons the three hornes of the Deuill. And in deed it was attributed to the Biſhop of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, called Maximinus, againſt whom S. Auguſtine hath written. And let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo that he ſpeaketh therein of the Manichies, of Lucian the Martyr, &amp; of the heretikes Homouſioi, all which roſe &amp; ſprung vp a long time after him; which is alſo confeſſed by themſelues: as likewiſe the Homilies of the ſaid author, <hi>in diuerſos.</hi> Let them alſo learne of S. Origen, that he would haue his works read, as the works of a man, and not of an Angell: <hi>Conſider and take good aduiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſo thou maiſt be able to iudge if that which we ſay may be made to agree with the ſcripture: I ſuſpect it, it is my coniecture, but trie and ſee if it may be ſo, &amp;c.</hi> But ſo it is, that he hath onely ſaid this &amp; nothing further: namely, that it is credible, that the ſaints retaining as yet their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and louing affections, do hartily deſire all maner of good vnto men. And now let vs ſee how far he was off from looking to enter into Paradice by the merites of the Saintes?
<note place="margin">Origen. hom. 17. in Luc.</note> 
                  <hi>What thinke we then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all the Apoſtles were offended in our Lord, and that not ſo much as his mother was exempted? Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if ſhe had not beene offended at the death of our Lord, Ieſus had not beene dead for her ſinnes. But if all haue ſinned, and ſtand in need of the grace of God, and are iustified and ſet at libertie by his grace, verily Mary her ſelfe for a time was offended: And it is the ſame which Simeon propheſieth, when he ſaith: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a ſword ſhall pearce through thy ſoule, euen thine who knoweſt thy ſelfe to haue brought forth a childe without the companie of man: yea euen thee who haſt hearde of Gabriel: The holy Ghoſt ſhall come vppon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall ouerſhadow thee: ſhall the ſword of in fidelitie wound with doubtfulneſſe and vncertaintie, as with a pricke, for that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thoughtes ſhall diſtract and teare thee in peeces, when thou ſhalt ſee him crucified and put to death, whom thou haſt heard called the Sonne of God?</hi>

And it is in this ſence that he ſaith: <hi>Let vs bee mindfull one of another; let vs pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euerie where: And thoſe of which ſhall firſt be called away hence, let them continue their amitie and loue without ceaſing in the preſence of God: let their prayers neuer ceaſe for their brethren and ſiſters, crauing in their behalfe the manifolde mercies of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> That is, Saynt Cyprian extending and ſtretching the care that the Saintes
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:15548:177"/>deceaſed ſhould haue, not vnto the Church in generall onely, but by a continuance of holy affection vnto them whome they had loued in Chriſt here vppon earth. And this although it haue no example in the ſcripture, yet it is far off from our aduerſaries their doctrine: for he prayeth to the liuing, and not to the dead. Now the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie or queſtion betwixt vs is not, if they pray, and to what end: but if wee ought to pray vnto them at all, I know well what they haue to alleadge out of the ſermon of the ſtarre, and the wiſemen of the Eaſt: As that the infantes ſlaine by Herode are made Senators in Paradice, and obtaine grace for them which doe not merite it, &amp;c. But they are not ignorant, that this ſermon hath by themſelues beene alwaies num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt the deuiſed and faigned ones. As likewiſe that which they bring out of the booke of S. Cyprian his penitentnes; How that he had beene a Magician, and that by the help of the Deuils hee would haue aſſailed the chaſtitie of a maide: and that ſhe calling vpon Ieſus Chriſt her husband, and afterward the virgine Marie, was deliuered: and thereupon alſo S. Cyprian conuerted. But with what face? ſeeing S. Ierome telleth vs, that S. Cyprian was a Rhetorician, and wonne vnto Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Hieronym. in epiſt. ad Paul. &amp; in Comment. in Ionam. c. 3. Cyp l. 2. ep. 2. Gelaſ. D. 15. c. Sancta Rom.</note> partly by the familiaritie he had with Caecilius, whereupon he was ſurnamed the Cecilian: and partly by the reading of the Prophete Ionas. And ſeeing that S. Cyprian in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe his owne conuerſion, ſaith not a worde of all this: And as little is that which commeth to light by Pontianus his Deacon, who hath written his life. But which is more, ſeeing that Pope Gelaſius at the verie ſame time, when the inuocation of Saints had rooted it ſelfe verie deeply, did pronounce and affirme vnto them, that this booke was Apocrypha. And yet they are ſtill abuſing the common people with the name of the fathers. For as concerning the ſermon of Gregorie Nazianzene, Marulla hath very well obſerued, that he hath made Cyprian of Damaſcus, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian the Carthaginian all one; whereas the firſt ſuffered in the time of Valerian, and the ſecond vnder Diocleſian: And it hath beene noted by many others before and after him.</p>
               <p>We are now in this place to bring in Dionyſius the pretended Areopagite: for hee cannot be ſo auncient, (as we haue proued) as they would make him:
<note place="margin">Dionvſ. eccleſ. Hierarch. c. 3.</note> and this we ſay and affirme by the way, that we need not doubt, that the miracles which God wrought vppon the eſtabliſhment of the Church, at the ſepulchers of the Martyrs, made many to looke downe and to fixe their eyes vppon the Martyrs, whereas they ought to haue lifted them vp, and to haue cauſed them to looke vpon God alone: and that ſo much the more becauſe it was called and accompted to be the honouring of God in his Saintes, as alſo for that it ſeemed to bee an inſtigation and pricking of men forward to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt. Whereunto alſo you may adde as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe the want of a Paule or Barnabas at the corner of euerie fielde, to repreſſe theſe diſordered and vnruly deuotions of the people;
<note place="margin">Actes 14.</note> and to cauſe them to leaue the creature, to betake themſelues to the liuing God. But ſo it is, that this Denys rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the cauſes for which he made mention of the Saintes in the ſeruice, ſpeaketh not but of thoſe that follow: <hi>To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thoſe that liue may learne by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to liue and die well in God: and that they might bee admoniſhed and taught, that thoſe that die in him, doe liue out of this life in a better: That God hath them in his remembrance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which is ſaid: God knoweth thoſe that are his: The death of the Saintes is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious before God: That they are alſo one with Christ by an indiſſoluble vnion and bond that can not bee broken: which are the cauſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that this mention or rehearſall is made at the time of the celebrating of the Sacrament, the Sacrament of the coniunction and vnion of Christ and his members:</hi> That is, to ſhew vnto vs, that thoſe that bee not the greateſt parte in this world that yet they ceaſe not to be a part of the Church.</p>
               <p>The contention raiſed about the Arrians, was a cauſe that for a certaine time men did ſpeake without fault. The Chriſtians reaſoned: Chriſt is truely God, for we are all agreed to pray vnto him: but we pray not vnto, neither call vppon any but God. This argument had beene of no force, if the Church at that time had vſed the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saintes, for the reply had beene verie readie: But tell mee how many Saintes
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15548:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>doe you pray vnto,
<note place="margin">Hillar. in pſal. 129.</note> which you know to be no Gods? And although S. Hillarie doe playe the Philoſopher as others before him, vppon the mediation of Angelles, the protection of the Patriarkes and Apoſtles, &amp;c. yet he reſerueth inuocation for Chriſt alone:

               <p>And now we be come to the time of the firſt Nicene Councell:

               <p>The praiers of the Saintes deceaſed for the liuing, were the particular opinions of Origen and Cyprian,
<note place="margin">The bringing in of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, by a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torica. l figure.</note> founded vpon a likelihood, and foſtered in the ſolitarie celles and cloiſters of Monkes, vntil ſuch time as they brought forth the offering vp of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the liuing vnto thoſe that were dead.

And Saint Baſill and Nazianzene,
<note place="margin">Anno 370.</note> who brought the Monkes out of Egypt and Syria into Greece, were the promoters and furtherers thereof, being the moſt famous Orators of that age: an age verily wherein the Church grew and proſpered greatly for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and wealth, by reaſon of the protection of the Empire: but therewithall grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heauy and laden with the errours of Paganiſme ſlipping into it, together with the multitudes of the Gentiles: the Church in the meane while being buſied in beating down the hereſies raiſed about the trinity, they being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their chief ſtrength: The quickeſt ſighted, conceiuing that they had gained no ſmall matter, when they had turned the Gentiles from their Gods to Angels,

But in the praier that hee made of the Martyr Manans, he went beyond the bounds of the order and obſeruation of the Church, &amp; falleth into the ſuperſtition of the common people: <hi>Call to your remembrances</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how oft you haue ſeene him in a dreame, and how oft he hath miniſtred help vnto you in your praiers, and in your iourneyes, &amp;c.</hi> This paſſeth the limits both of the ſcriptures, as alſo the decrees and ordinances of the Church: and it had beene better that he had kept himſelfe to the rule which he himſelfe elſewhere doth giue vnto vs: As, <hi>That to depart from the ſcriptures is to fall away from the faith.</hi> But yet our aduerſaries not contented with this, will make him ſay more then he would.

And as yet there are to be ſeene the Chappels of S. Michael, amongst their bordering neighbours. Now this their counſell was couered with the cloake of humilitie: for they alleadged that the God of the vniuerſal world is inuiſible, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and not to be approached: and therefore of neceſſitie man is conſtrained to vſe them to the procuring of Gods fauour. And this is it which S. Paul calleth through humilitie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Angels. And he addeth, practiſing or intruding himſelfe into matters: which hee hath not ſeene: that is to ſay, vſing his owne conceipts.</hi> And in the third Chapter: S. <hi>Paul commandeth, that they giue thankes to God the Father by Chriſt, and not by his Angels: But the Synode of Laodicea following this law, laboured to cure this old diſeaſe, and therefore ordained that they ſhould not pray vnto Angels,

Now theſe honors, ſuch as is adoration, as alſo inuocation, are parts of that which he calleth Latria.

And whereas the abuſe did grow more plauſible, by reaſon of the name of the virgine Marie: <hi>There are ſome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which do not honor her ſufficiently; &amp; there are ſome that glorifie her too much.

               <p>As concerning the Saints deceaſed, he ſometimes ſpeaketh of them according to the common opinion,
<note place="margin">Idem in Baſil.

But haue they not purchaſed Paradiſe by their ſufferings and merites, and not for themſelues onely, but for thoſe alſo that call vpon them? Not ſo, for they are farre off from that. On the contrarie, ſaith he, <hi>God alone is without ſinne:
<note place="margin">Idem hom. 40. in Geneſ. &amp; 49. Idem in hom. 45. in Mat. Idem hom. 20 in Iohan.</note> and to the end that he might bee without ſinne, he permitted Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to ſinne by infidelitie, Moiſes by ingratitude, the virgine likewiſe the mother of Chriſt in his paſsion by doubting:</hi> Animum matris gladius dubitationis pertranſijt, &amp;c. <hi>The ſword</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>of doubting or diffidencie pearced her ſoule.</hi> Likewiſe ſaith hee, <hi>Sometimes by ambition, by vanitie, and by the forgetting of the diuinitie of the Son, &amp;c.</hi> As if of purpoſe he would preuent or repreſſe the abuſe which ſprung vp then, and grew ſtronger after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the inuention and induſtrie of the Monkes about the infinite merites of the holy Virgine.</p>
               <p>What haue they to oppoſe and ſet againſt this? The Liturgie of Chryſoſtome? but we haue heretofore auouched for a certaine truth, that it was compiled &amp; made more then 500. yeares after him. An homelie of the natiuity of S. Peter and S. Paule, wherein they make him ſay: <hi>Peter and Paule pray for vs without ceaſing; for you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo to do.</hi> And where? <hi>You Paule, when you ſaid,</hi> Venite mecum, &amp; bonis ne defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amur: <hi>and you Peter,</hi> Studebo poſt meum obitum, &amp;c. But the beſt learned haue beene aſhamed to giue it place amongſt his workes.
<note place="margin">Idem in hom. poſt reditum ab exilio.</note> But doe they make no conſcience to make him to alleadge the ſcripture ſo falſlie? In that which he made returning from exile: <hi>I haue inuited and bid you to ſupper</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the Apostles: let vs come to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, to Andrew, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore hee teacheth them ſay they, to haue recourſe vnto ſaints. Whereas he rather diſcourſeth in that place, to what perſecutions the ſaintes are ſubiect, and ſendeth them to conſider the examples of thoſe aboue named, to the end that they might not be ſtrange or vnacquainted with any thing that they ſhould find.
<note place="margin">Idem hom. 5. in Mat.</note> Neither is that worthie better to be truſted, which they alleadge out of the fift homelie vpon S. Mathew: <hi>That which we ſay is not to be denied, that we ought not to pray vnto the Saintes.</hi> For his wordes are: <hi>And we ſay well; not that we denie, that the Saintes ought to pray for ſinners:</hi> that is, as we haue before ſhewed, the ſaints aliue. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all this homelie maketh for the contrarie. And in deed Bellarmine hath beene aſhamed to alleadge the places aboue named, holding himſelfe to one onely in the threeſcore and ſixt homelie vnto the people of Antioch. <hi>The Emperour</hi> (for ſo they make him to ſay) <hi>is there himſelfe with his purple, to beſeech the Saintes to make interceſsion
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:15548:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>vnto God for him. He praieth vnto a maker of tabernacles, and a fiſher, as his protectors.</hi> But it is to be noted, that the ſame words are read in a ſermon attributed vnto S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, <hi>De Sancto Paulo:</hi> and the Canon Garet doth alleadge them of one Theodoret Daphnoipatus of farre latter time. So little certaintie is there, whether it be S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines or S. Chryſoſtomes, being alſo directly contrarie to the whole bodie and ſcope of their doctrine.

               <p>Cyrill Patriarke of Alexandria followeth them neere by, both for the time and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. His Maxims are: <hi>None commeth to the father but by Chriſt: The Sonne was made the dore and the way to reconcile men vnto the father, and he himſelfe doth diſtribute and giue grace together with him, &amp;c.

Iulianus the Emperour reprocheth him, you Chriſtians ye worſhip a man: <hi>Yea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyril. ad Reg. de rect. fid.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>but ſuch a man as we acknowledge and confeſſe to bee both man and God together.</hi> But at the leaſt the Martyrs: <hi>Nay not ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as that we hold them for Gods: we doe not adore or worſhip them: wee praiſe their conſtancie, in hauing hated their lines for the truth, &amp;c.</hi> And he telleth vs wherein this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor conſiſteth: <hi>In a remembrance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which withereth not, euen of their excellent and exceeding fortitude.</hi> He forgetteth not in the meane time to deſcribe how many waies the Greekes honoured their Gods, euen betaking themſelues vnto them, as prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and gardiantes of ſuch as were aliue.

<note place="margin">Idem in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaur. l. 4. c. 2.</note> and the mutuall praiers of others: but they cannot imparte it vnto others at their pleaſures: whereas the Sonne, as the fountaine of holineſſe, doth ſanctifie his diſciples by his owne power: Receiue, ſaith he, the holie Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> The Concluſion of Cyrill, in the end, after all this diſputation, is: <hi>Therefore we must praie in the name of the Sauiour, if we will be heard of the father.</hi> And notwithſtanding ſome are growne to that impudencie, contrarie to the opinion of all ancient writers, as to impute and aſcribe vnto him a little booke imprinted in times paſt in Paris. <hi>The liturgie and houres of the virgine Marie.</hi> As for Theodoret, we haue ſeene heretofore what he ſaid vnto vs of the Councell of Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea: and yet further we muſt not forget what he ſaith vnto vs of the wordes of Saint Paule to Timothie: <hi>One Mediator of God and men, &amp;c.

               <p>In the time of S.

And this is proued by the diſputation betwixt Saint Ierome and Vigilantius:
<note place="margin">Hieronym. contr. Vigilant.</note> whether it were that on the one ſide Vigilantius did not ſpeake honorably enough of the Martyrs: or that Saint Ierome doth wrongfully ſo charge him: proceeding here as in other places, from wholeſome admonition and reproofe, to hot and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red choller, (a man for that cauſe certainely vnworthy to bee admitted into any diſputation concerning religion:) But of all Vigilantius his Theſes, (becauſe his bookes are not to bee come by) we are onely made acquainted with ſo much as Saint Ierome maketh mention of. It is manifeſt likewiſe, that the Church of Fraunce did not allow of this ſuperſtition; in as much as that French Biſhoppe, of whome Saint Ierome ſpeaketh vnto Ripacius, a holy and reuerent man, did hold the opinion of Vigilantius: according to that which Ireneus ſaith; That the French men and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines held and kept ſo faſt what they had firſt receiued of the Apoſtolike faith, as that they ſhutte their eares vnto whatſoeuer departed and ſwarued from the ſame. Vigilantius ſaith by the report of Saint Ierome; That wee muſt not worſhip or adore the Martyrs, nor the deceaſed Saintes. And who can denie that which hee ſaith of worſhip and adoration? But for the honour due and of right to bee giuen in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of the Martyrs and Saintes, by the acknowledging of the giftes of God in them, and the imitation of their conſtancie; who is hee that would contend or ſtriue againſt it? But you ſay that in this honour inuocation is included: which thing Vigilantius denyed. Let them ſhew vs then in all this diſputation, how hot ſoeuer S. Ierome be, any one word of the inuocation of ſaints or of Martyrs? or any one proofe or allegation that he maketh for the ſame, either out of the ſcriptures, or the fathers, the Councels or the Liturgies Greeke or Latine? Howſoeuer notwithſtanding the caſe ſo ſtandeth, as that he could not bee ignorant of that goodly Maſſe of S. Iames at Ieruſalem, if ſo be it were at that time, for to haue proued thereby the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the virgine Marie and of the Saintes. For as concerning that which he ſaith: <hi>If any man come to pray</hi> ad memorias Martyrum: it is well knowne, that that was for no other thing but to point the place, where had beene accuſtomed for a long time the meetinges of the Chriſtian aſſemblies, to ſtirre vp thereby thoſe which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the like conſtancie.</p>
               <p>Origen was the firſt that ſaid, though doubtfully, and ambiguouſly; That the bleſſed ſoules do pray in the other world for the Church. Vpon this ſtone men haue laboured by degrees to found and ſettle this inuocation. Vigilantius doth take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by this foundation, and denieth it, adding, that here we ought to pray one for another: &amp; that there is not any place for this action elſwhere. S. Ierome ſtriueth for this propoſition of Origens, as for an article of faith; Vigilant. gainſaith it, as contrary
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:15548:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>vnto faith: but of them paſſing beyond their bounds, ſeeing that this propoſition, if a man ſtay there and go no further, is indifferently to be borne with of the Church. But S. Ierome gathereth therevpon this concluſion. The Saintes pray vnto God in heauen for the Church: therefore the Church here vppon earth muſt not onely pray vnto God, but vnto the Saints alſo.</p>
               <p>Superſtition ſaid: But wherefore ſhal we not pray vnto them, ſeeing that they pray for vs? For is there not appearance, that they ioyne their praiers vnto ours, when we pray vnto them at their graues? &amp;c. Vigilantius aunſwereth; No, for they doe not meddle any more with humane affaires: So far is it off that their ſoules ſhould keepe about theſe graues.

And thinke not for all this that thou doeſt iniurie vnto thoſe holy hils: for theſe are the hils themſelues, which ſing of him vnto thee. S.

So, when thou ſhalt haue lift vp thine eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountaines from whence thy helpe is to come, that is to ſay, towards the writers of the holy Scriptures; heare them attentiuely, which crie vnto thee from the depth of their bones, from the bottomes and innermoſt parts of their marrow; O Lord, who is like vnto thee? &amp;c.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:15548:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>of one onely mediatour. For Chriſtians doe recommend one an other in their praiers: but he alone is the true mediator which maketh interceſsion for all, and for whome no man praieth. So Paul though a principall member vnder the head, but yet notwithſtanding a member, recommendeth himſelfe to the praiers of the faithfull: he maketh not himſelfe any mediatour betwixt the people and God; but he praieth that all the members of the body of Christ would praie for him, &amp;c. For if Paul were a mediatour, then all his fellow Apoſtles ſhould be ſo likewiſe:
<note place="margin">Non conſtaret ei ratio. Idem in 1. Ep.

He that hath held this, hath not ſpotted himſelfe with hereſie, hath not fallen into ſchiſme. For hence it is that ſchiſmes ariſe, when men ſay, we are iuſt and righteous; we ſanctifie the vncleane, we iuſtifie the wicked, we praie, we obtaine, &amp;c. And the Saints then</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doe they not pray for vs? And the Biſhops doe not they pray for the people?

<note place="margin">Auguſt. ad Hieronym. de natura &amp; origi. animarum. Idem in quaeſt. veter. &amp; Nou. teſt. q 73.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is not any one ſoule, in all mankind</hi> (thus hee writ vnto S.

               </p>
               <p>What doe we get by this diſcourſe? Verily that vnto the time of S. Chryſoſtome and S. Auguſtine, that is to ſay, neere hand fine hundred yeares after the death of our Lord, there was no Inuocation of Saints in the Chriſtian Church, nor any mention of the ſame in the ſeruice of the Church: that it was practiſed onely by the particular deuotions of ſome few, which they had learned for the moſt part out of the Schoole of the Gentiles, and that there were great perſonages at thoſe times, that laboured to repreſſe them, by the oppoſing and ſetting of the pure doctrine againſt them, as wee haue ſeene by their diſputations. And if that they did ſpeake ſo, at ſuch time as thoſe myracles, which it pleaſed God to worke for the confirmation of the faith, and the approuing of his Martyrs, were moſt freſh and new, what would they haue ſaid of that which we ſee at this day, when wee pray not vnto God, as then, in the burying places of the Martyrs; but vnto the Martyrs themſelues: yea and to all the ſorts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Saints; both directly, &amp; as the authors of good things, and without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of God, and in their images? And whereas they ſcrape together here and there ſome places, that ſeeme to make for them, ſome of them being true, but ill tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, ſome manifeſtly fained and deuiſed; and ſome drawne from Rhetoricke, to make proofes and reaſons in Diuinitie, what other thing may they ſeeme to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but Spiders, which out of moſt wholeſome hearbs doe ſucke poyſon, whereas the Bees doe gather ſweetneſſe out of the moſt bitter?</p>
               <p>And here withall let vs not forget to obſerue and note, that at this time, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ages after, it was indifferent in the Church: whether the faithfull departing out of this world, were by and by gathered vnto God, and inioyed his preſence: or elſe, that they continued expecting the day of the reſurrection, in the boſome of Abraham in a place of moſt bleſſed reſt, from thence to bee receiued into heauen all together. Which is more, Ireneus, Iuſtine, Tertullian, Origen, Saint Ambroſe, Saint Auguſtine, Saint Chryſoſtome,

Now the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that the Inuocation of Saints, is grounded vpon interceſsion; and their interceſsion vpon the ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, according to our Aduerſaries their owne doctrine. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the Inuocation of Saints could not haue any ground to grow vpon in the Church all this time; neither yet ſhall hereafter in any ſure or certaine ſort, according to Saint Barnard his iudgement, who liued not aboue three hundred yeares ſince: ſeeing he ſtood more vppon this opinion then any other; the Inuocation of Saints beeing ſuch as could not match with this doctrine.</p>

               <p>But now behold commeth Gregorie to the Biſhoppricke of the See of Rome,

He findeth the people all readie tilled &amp; husbanded fit for the receiuing of ſuch ſeed; throughly prepared by their cuſtomes taken from Paganiſme, and by the inſtructing of the Monkes, to approue this change and alteration. He then turned the Commemoration of the Saints in the Maſſe, into Inuocation, and put by name into the Letanie, <hi>Sancta Maria ora pro nobis, Saint Marie pray for vs:</hi> he ordained and cauſed the Maſſe to bee celebrated vpon the bodies of S.

               <p>This before deliuered, appeareth true, by the Liturgies which they alleadge themſelues: Of S. Iames, where the Prieſt confeſſeth himſelfe to none but God, and

Of that which was vnder S.

For hauing ſaid: <hi>In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and worſhipping the memoriall of the holy Virgine, of ſuch men Saints, and women Saints, &amp;c.</hi> it followed that the Prieſt ſaid ſome thing, and he cut it off al too ſhort, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſentence imperfect and hanging in ſuſpence, for this cauſe &amp; conſideration, that he might make an end with a praier which he linked thereunto, and it is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome to Pope Siricius, &amp; by others to Gregory. Of the Letanie, altogether after the like manner: for it was a generall praier, which was made into Articles, for all the neceſsities of the body of the Church, and of the members therof, yea for the eſtate of the world, &amp;c.

And in al the Liturgies aboue named, all theſe Articles are craued of one onely God by Ieſus Chriſt. Likewiſe that of Clement the Pope, <hi>Pro ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perna pace Deum oremus, pro ſalute animarum noſtrarum, pro proſperitate ſanctarum eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, pro clero &amp; populo, pro magiſtratibus totius mundi, Let vs pray for the peace that is on high, for the ſaluation of our ſoules, for the proſperitie of the holy Churches, for the Cleargie, for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaltie, for the Princes of the world, &amp;c.</hi> And to euery Article that the Deacon pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the people and the Cleargie anſwered: <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs.</hi> But for as much as the third Councell of Carthage had ſaid, that all praiers ſhould be directed &amp; made to God; thoſe who had reſolued to thruſt in the Inuocation of Saints, began indirectly: <hi>O Lord, heare vs by the interceſsion of the Virgin; Lord, doe thou prepare and guide our waies &amp; pathes by the praiers of thy Saints, &amp;c.</hi> But Gregorie proceedeth further, euen to a direct praier; <hi>Saint Mary, pray for vt, &amp;c.</hi> And to the end that this might find a more gracious intertainment &amp; welcome, it was ſaid, that there were ſome that had heard the Angels in the celebration of a certaine ſolemne Letanie, crying: <hi>Regina coeli laetare; Reioyce thou Queene of heauen, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gregor. l. 12.

Nay rather it belonged to them to incroach dayly, &amp; enter deeper into blaſphemy.

<note place="margin">Anton. Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cp. in tit. 23. c. 11.</note> the Archb. Antonine therefore that was of this order, peiſeth his miracles, not againſt thoſe of S. Frauncis, but againſt the miracles of our Lord, &amp; giueth them the ſtart &amp; prerogatiue both for number, &amp; for greatnes. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>raiſed but three from death at all; Dominick at Rome onely raiſed as many; and 40. neere to Tholoſa, which were drowned on horſebacke in the riuer Garona, beſides infinite others. Chriſt after his reſurrection went in to his diſciples the dores being ſhut: Dominick whilet yet he bare about this mortall bodie, which is much more, went into the temple, the dores being faſt.</hi> Now by the way let vs note, that this was by their owne ſpeech, either by the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a ſpirituall and glorified bodie, or els by an Almightie power. And thus he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through all the miracles of our Lord, alwaies preferring and giuing S. Dominick the vpper hand. To be ſhort, Chriſt ſaid after his death: <hi>All power is giuen to me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and in earth: and verily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this power was not in a ſmall meaſure communicated &amp; bestowed vpon Dominicke ouer all things in heauen, earth or hell, and that euen in this life: for he had Angels to attend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſerue him, the elements obaied him, and the deuils trembled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</hi> And this he laieth downe in many examples. He addeth further, that at Rome there were two images, the one of S. Paul, and the other of S. Dominick: &amp; that at the feet of the former was written: <hi>Per istum itur ad Christum; by this men go to Chriſt:</hi> and at the feet of the latter: <hi>Facilius itur per iſtum, but more eaſily and readily by this man, that is to ſay, by Dominicke.</hi> That is, ſaith Antonine, <hi>Becauſe that the doctrine of Paul and the Apoſtles induced and perſuaded men to belieue: but Dominicks to obſerue and keep the councels, Which is a ſhorter courſe and cut.</hi> And thus you may already ſee, that he was more then S. Paul and all the Apoſtles. But what ſhall we ſay now of that which followeth? <hi>Quia</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Domino nostro ſimilis eſt, Dominicus aptiſsimé denominatus eſt, verie fitlie and rightly was he called Dominicke, becauſe he was like</hi> Domino, <hi>to our Lord. And he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsiuelie in poſſeſsion, that which our Lord was authoritatiuely in authoritie: for the Lord ſaid, I am the light of the world; and the Church ſingeth of Dominick, you are the light of the world. The Prophets beare witneſſe</hi> Domino, <hi>vnto the Lord, and to Dominicke alſo. Zacharie</hi> 11. <hi>I haue choſen me two roddes; the one I haue called</hi> Decorem, <hi>beautie; that is to ſay, the order of Saint Dominicke: the other</hi> Funiculum, <hi>a corde or band, that is the order of the Gray fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> (thus they abuſe the ſcripture) <hi>Dominus, that is to ſay, our Lord, was borne on the bare earth, but the virgine for feare of cold laid him in a manger:</hi> Dominicus <hi>from his ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing clothes, abhorring the pamperinges and tender delightes of the worlde, was found often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his nurſe, lying all naked vpon the bare earth. For our Lord there appeared a ſtarre in beauen, in token that he did lighten the whole world: In the forehead likewiſe of Dominicke, as he was baptiſed the Godmother espied a ſtar, ſignifying a new light to be borne into the world, &amp;c. The praier of our Lord was euer more heard when he would: for in the garden, that which he asked of a fleſhlie deſire hee would not obtaine according to reaſon: But Dominick neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any thing of God which he did not whollie enioy according to his owne deſire.</hi> Dominus <hi>that is, our Lord loued vs, and waſhed vs from our ſinnes in his blood: Dominicke through a perfection of charitie, tooke euerie daie three diſciplines or corrections from his owne hand, not with a corde, but with an iron chaine, euen to the cauſing of his blood to runne downe: One for his faults, though they were verie ſmall; another for thoſe that were in Purgatorie; and the third for them that liued here in the world, &amp;c.</hi> And thus this Archbiſhop Antonine draweth this compariſon through all the parts of the life of our Lord. In a word our Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depart out of this world, promiſeth the Comforter vnto his diſciples: <hi>And Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick ſaith vnto his; Be not grieued, for I wil do you more good in the place whither I go, then I haue done here: for there you haue me a better aduocate then any other that you can haue there, &amp;c.</hi> And what ſhall now become of that which S.

As for that which may follow after, what authoritie, or what credite is it worthie to haue? Lombard vpon a good intent began to ſay: That it was to be belieued, that ſhee was purged from originall ſinne, when ſhee conceiued our Lord. Some others would adde thereunto; that ſhe ſhould haue beene conceiued in originall ſinne: but that ſhee ſhould be borne without ſinne, hauing beene ſanctified in the wombe of her mother.

Neither is he heire becauſe he obeyeth, but becauſe he is a child: a child, who by obeying cannot merite this inheritaunce; for it is his part and dutie: who notwithſtanding by diſobeying, might looſe it, and that euerie houre; in as much certainely as the inheritance depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the father, and that grace is loſt by ingratitude, if it be not renued &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the goodneſſe of the father: a bountifull goodneſſe, deſcending more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the father to the Sonne, then it aſcendeth from the Sonne to the father.</p>
               <p>And this againe is the cauſe,
<note place="margin">The loue of God, the gift of God.</note> wherefore it is a gift of God, that this loue of God, which worketh good workes in vs: this loue of God, which hath begotten vs for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to him in the bloud of Chriſt: euen that this ſame loue ſhould giue vs to be true children, and ſhould giue vs to loue God, by the operation of his ſpirit. This free loue I ſay of the Lord, which hath iuſtified vs in his bloud, and ſanctified vs by his ſpirit: in as much as the merit of Chriſt worketh not only to the obtaining of the remiſsion of our ſinnes,

And the Phariſies, who taught that it was in the power of man to fulfil the Law; hauing alſo theſe ſame workes of ſupererogation, whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh ſaying; <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> Of theſe, according to the diuers obſeruations which they had tied themſelues vnto, the Thalmud maketh ſeuen ſects; but one eſpecially which had this name: <hi>What ought I to doe, and I will doe it?</hi> And of theſe we haue an example in him that is ſpoken of in the Goſpell: <hi>All theſe things haue I done euen from my youth, &amp;c.</hi> Both the one and the other being verie vnfit to caſt and repoſe themſelues vpon the reſt of grace; and by conſequent enemies of our Lord, who reckoneth more baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe ſorts of people, then of the Publicans and harlors.

Whereupon S. Iohn Baptiſt, preparing the way to this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to vnbewitch them, beginneth his Sermons at that point: <hi>Repent, the kingdome of beauen is at hand, &amp;c.</hi> So then ſome of the circumciſion that receiued Chriſt, brought this errour into the Church of Chriſt: as alſo they which did obſtinately cleaue vnto Iudaiſme, had not any other ground for the ſame, then the righteouſneſſe purchaſed by the Law; and the workes thereof, in which their courſe they are croſſed by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of Paul written to the Romaines and Galathians: for in them he oppoſeth and ſetteth againſt their righteouſneſſe of workes, that which is of faith and grace; giuing them to conſider the enormitie of ſinne, and the ſoundneſſe and ſinceritie of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God: In ſumme he bringeth them backe, to the ſeeking out of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the Croſſe of Chriſt; their bleſſedneſſe and righteouſneſſe, in that that he is made a curſe and ſinne for them. And yet notwithſtanding this doctrine, being of the nature of that old Serpent, cannot be ſo cut in peeces by the ſword of Gods word, but that it taketh hold againe and knitteth together. And ſo much the rather,
<note place="margin">Merit main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Philoſophers, brought into the Church.</note> by how much the flocking of the Gentiles into the Church was the greater, to whome it was plauſible, as agreeing with the Philoſophie of the world, and their free will, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all mans preſumption and ouerweening; beeing admitted into the bodie of Diuinitie by the Greeke Doctors, who ſprung out of the ſame Schoole, more eaſily then was either meete or needfull. Now the chiefe brocher of the ſame, was one Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius a Briton borne, about the yeare 400. in the Latine Church, who had beene a Monke in Syria, and had many other Monkes his followers.
<note place="margin">Merit of workes confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> But God raiſed vp vnto vs alſo in thoſe times, to withſtand this doctrine, Saint Ierome, Proſper Aquitanus, Fulgentius, Primaſius, and other great perſons, who ſharply confuted and gaineſaid the ſame; and aboue all, one Saint Auguſtine,
<note place="margin">Reſiſtance and head made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame</note> who ouerthrew all the foundations of the ſame: who alſo tooke occaſion by this ſtumbling ſtone, to plucke vp by the rootes all manner of preſumption and preiudicate opinions, which in the former times had crept into the Church, by the meanes of Circumciſion, Paganiſme, the Law or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie. What followed hereupon? He ſhould haue rooted out men and all: ſo deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had this ſprout taken roote in man. For no ſooner was Saint Auguſtine departed this world, but this hereſie ſprung vp a new in a Monke called Caſsianus, meanely learned, taking his beginning, to the end hee might find a more eaſie and plauſible entrance) at a third Aſſertion, conſiſting of a meane or middle nature betwixt the doctrine of Saint Auguſtine and Pelagius: and by this meanes preuailed and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of verie greatly in our Countrie of France: who yet found preſently there to withſtand and refell him the foreſaid Proſper Aquitanus, and certaine others. This man at that time taught, that many attained grace, without grace, by the only power of free will: That man crauing the ſame of himſelfe, it was giuen him, and afterward grew and increaſed, according to the proportion of his merits: That as fully, there might be certaine men found, who, how vnwilling ſo euer they might be, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding made partakers of this grace, through pure and meere grace. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two ſortes of Chriſtians, one ſaued by free will, and the other freely by grace: That it was in the power of man after his fall, of himſelfe to doe good workes: yea to merit eternall life. But what ſaith Proſper thereupon vnto him: Who (if any others) was mightie in the Scriptures? And here it ſtood him vpon, to haue alleadged him wholly: Verily, that it behoued him to haue firmely held the doctrine of Saint Paule, being moſt excellently expounded by Saint Auguſtine, and accordingly hee draweth our Countrie men thereunto moſt learnedly: That no man obtaineth grace, but of pure and meere grace: That they that flie thereunto through the feare of death, and thoſe which runne thereto with a ioyfull hope, are helped and aſsiſted thereunto, by one and the ſame grace: That man in Adam hath loſt all the meanes of comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternall life, all the ſeedes of pietie and vertue: That who ſo attributeth our merits vnto any other then God, or vnto man any other thing but his deſerts, doth greatly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:15548:209"/>erre, and ſpeake againſt the ſcriptures; were he a Iob, a Prophete, or an Apoſtle, the law hauing beene giuen to no other end but to condemne vs, and conſequently to make vs to be altred and chaunged by grace. And yet notwithſtanding all this, this ſaid hereſie and naturall claime of nature againſt grace, doth not ceaſe continually to returne and ſwimme aloft, being relieued by the Monkes, the Phariſies of theſe latter times, blowen vp and kindled by the common people, who willingly hold and ſuffer themſelues to be perſwaded, that their ſaluation is of themſelues, neglected by the ſucceeding Biſhops, the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ignorant, maintained by the groſſe &amp; palpable darkneſſe, which for a long time vnder the ouerflowing of barbariſme, did couer all the world: God notwithſtanding not ſuffering this truth of ſaluation in the ſaith of one only Chriſt to be chooked &amp; extinguiſhed, as is eaſie to be verified by the writings of the moſt famous &amp; renowned that haue liued heretofore. For Greg. ſaith: <hi>We are redeemed by grace:

And as for them which boaſt themſelues of being ſaued by their merits, they are contrarie vnto themſelues: for whiles they deſire to be innocent and redeemed, they fruſtrate and make of no value the redemption in them.</hi> But ſaith he in another place: <hi>Notwithſtanding that the ſoule of the holy man do wander out of the way of righteouſnes: yet if it lay faſt hold by faith on him which iuſtifieth the ſinner, and bewaile vnceſſantly the ſinnes committed in the time of this faith, by ſuch his continual waſhings, it retaineth and kepeth stil his righteouſnes.</hi> And of faith he hath theſe Maxims verie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and ſamiliar:

                  <hi>All the Saints before the comming of Chriſt were ſaued by faith: let vs not put our confidence in our teares and mourning, neither yet in our deedes, but in the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Aduocate: faith goeth before brotherly loue and charitie: It must bee firſt preached and taught, thereby to raiſe vs vp vnto good workes: vertues bring vs not to beleeue, but faith bringeth vs to a vertuous life: True faith is that which ſaith it, and harboreth not any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or manners contrarie vnto the ſame; we hold faſt the faith, and therewithall wee exerciſe it in good workes.</hi> What is all this, but the ſame which we affirme and ſay: That the iuſt man liueth by faith: that his faith ſheweth it ſelfe aliue by his workes. In the ſame ſence dooth alſo Caſſiodorus, Olympiodorus, Orgelitanus, and others of the ſame time, verie often ſpeake, although not altogether ſo properly in certaine places.</p>

Then in ſtead of the teaching of one onely remiſſion of ſinnes, in the onely bloud of Chriſt, and that in ſuch ſort, as that it was famous and reuerently receiued throughout al the time that the purer antiquitie continued; Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie and Caſſiodorus had begun to teach: that ſins were remitted and forgiuen by martyrdome, almes deedes, forgiuing of our brethren, reclaiming of a ſinner, &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging notwithſtanding, that nothing of all this ſtood good, otherwiſe then in faith; but contrarily that it was continually euill, and againſt true and liuely faith.

This was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Pelagius his opinion, which (as our aduerſaries) they thought that they had well and ſufficiently qualified when they ſaid: That the firſt grace was of God, the firſt remiſsion and forgiueneſſe of Baptiſme; and as for all the reſt,
<note place="margin">Anno. 800.</note> we ought to ſeeke and ſearch for it in our ſelues, &amp; by our works. Now the inuocating and praying vnto Saints, iumping and falling in togither with the ſame, about this time, did fortifie and adde more force to the error. And it is to be noted, that as in the change of the winds, we ſee the cloudes in doubtfull ſort to wauer, and as it were ſtagger, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vpon, and take the direct courſe before the winde: euen ſo it fared with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writing of thoſe times,

<note place="margin">Idem in c. 2. ad Galath.</note> and therefore no man by anie meanes can be iuſtified by workes, but onely by faith, which proceedeth of grace.</hi> And yet herewithall I am not ignorant, that ſometimes theſe ſelfe ſame Doctors doe attribute much to workes. As when Haimo following Ceſarius his trace,
<note place="margin">Haimo ſuper Euang. in oct. Paſch.</note> ſetteth downe ſeuen waies for the obtaining of remiſſion of ſins. And when Rabanus recommendeth to the ſame end, faſting and almes deedes: and yet rather as themſelues ſay, <hi>To enter into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of recompence for their veniall ſinnes</hi> (which notwithſtanding is contrarie to their owne Maxims) <hi>then to merite &amp; rather thereby to ſhew forth ſome tokens of repentance, then to make vp any worke of ſatiſfaction, &amp;c.</hi> Then thus it behoueth, namely, that their Maxims ſtand firme and immoueable, and that what they ſay more, bee ſquared and bounded by them; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe ſuch Maxims are vttered by them, at ſuch times as when they ſpeake not after the conceipt of their owne corrupt and carnall ſence, but as ſearchers and ſeekers out of the true and proper ſence and meaning of the word of God. And yet notwithſtanding all this, we are farre off from thoſe kindes of doctrine, which came to bee preached in the beginning of this age, wherein we liue, namely; <hi>That workes without faith do merite to receiue and haue faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: That the works of the faithful do merite &amp; deſerue eternall life: That Chriſtians are able to merite the ſame, not only for themſelues, but alſo for others, &amp;c.</hi> And thus we are come to the yeare 1100. But this was the miſchiefe, that that which was preached ordinarilie to the people by the Prieſtes, whether couetous or ignorant could, more preuayle to leade them out of the way, then the other which was written by theſe Doctors,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:15548:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>who were not but for the learned, could worke to reduce and bring them into the way. And on the other ſide, that the ſoile whereinto this euill ſeede fell, was verie apt to receiue and intertaine this abuſe; namely, the naturall pride and preſumption of man. And yet further we are to note and obſerue, that which wee haue ſeene, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the inuocation of Saints: that in the Catechiſme of the ſicke, or rather ſuch as draw neere their death,
<note place="margin">Anſelm. in Ep. manuſcript.</note> drawne out of the Epiſtles of Anſelme, they were daily taught to oppoſe and ſet againſt the reprochfull checkes of Sathan, and the deadly accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their owne conſciences, nothing but the onely merit of our Lord: and againſt the wrath of God for ſinne, no other thing then his righteouſneſſe. And for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe, by a place out of Anſelme; a ſufficient ſcantling and taſte whereby wee may ſee what conſideration all the holy men of the ſame age,
<note place="margin">Anſelme in medit.</note> bad of this matter. <hi>My life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth aſtoniſh me; for when I haue well and throughly ſifted it, I find it either wholly ſinne, or elſe nothing but barrenneſſe. But and if there appeare any fruit, it is either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit or imperfect, or elſe corrupted and ſpoyled, in ſuch ſort as that it cannot poſsibly pleaſe God, yea that it cannot poſsibly but diſpleaſe him. In ſumme, either it is wholly inwrapped in ſinne, and thereupon damnable: or vnfruitfull and thereby contemptible. But what cauſe or neede is there, that there ſhould a difference be put betweene vnfruitfull and damnable? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once proued vnfruitfull, is it not by and by damnable? Seeing that euerie tree, that bringeth not foorth fruit is good for nothing but to bee caſt into the fire? Thou therefore O withered and vnfruitfull ſtocke that thou art, worthie of eternall fire, what wilt thou aunſwere in that daie, when an accompt ſhall bee taken of thee, euen in the twinkling of an eye, of all that time which thou ſhalt haue ſpent? What will bee the diſtreſse, that will then come vpon thee? When ſinne ſhall accuſe thee, and righteouſneſſe aſtoniſh thee, the gulfe of Hell vnder thee, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Iudge in heauie wrath and indignation ouer thee: within thee, a conſcience that boyleth thee: and without, the world which ſetteth thee on fire? And ſeeing that the righteous man is ſcarcely ſaued, the ſinner when he is come vpon and taken at vnawares, what hole or corner will hee ſeeke out to ſhroude himſelfe in? When it ſhall bee impoſsible for him to hide himſelfe, and intollerable to appeare and ſtand foorth in ſight? Whence ſhall I borrow counſaile, and where ſhal I find ſaluation and deliuerance? Except it bee from the boſome of that Angell of the great Councell? Euen from my Ieſus, who is ſaluation it ſelfe? And yet alſo that Judge, vnder whoſe hands I tremble and ſhake. Recouer thy ſelfe and take better hold O ſinner whoſoeuer thou art: deſpaire not: hope in him whome thou feareſt; flie vnto him, from whome thou didſt flie and runne away. Say vnto him: O Chriſt, for the loue of thy name, deale and doe with me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy name: looke downe vpon me miſerable caitife calling vpon thee. Bee thou vnto me a Ieſus for thy name ſake: If thou receiue me into the large and ſpatious boſome of thy mercie, there ſhall not remaine any more ſtraightneſſe or anguiſh through my miſerie for me. And although I confeſſe that my conſcience hath merited condemnation, and that my repentaunce cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto ſatisfaction: yet am I certaine that thy mercie is aboue all whatſoeuer manner of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.</hi>

Namely herein, that Dauid and others moe haue not pearced him through with their ſinnes; and that he accompliſheth by his exceeding great faithfulneſſe what hee had promiſed of his exceeding great grace. And this righteouſneſſe tendeth in fidem, vnto an other faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not poſsible, that any man ſhould be iuſtified before him, by his workes, but by faith:

That the life of faith, euen as that of trees, is knowne becauſe it bringeth forth fruit. In a word, that wee are iuſtified by faith onely? And yet ſuch a faith, as is neuer alone, but which containeth in it a certaine heate, which is naturall vnto it, alwayes acting ſomewhat, neuer idle, continually bringing foorth, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of water, the effects of loue, which it beareth towards God, and the good works it performeth vnto neighbours.</p>
               <p>But Saint Bernard, whome we haue ſo oft heretofore cited, goeth further then all the reſt: For there was in his time a certaine man named Petrus Abailardus, a verie Pelagian, who durſt ſay: <hi>That whereas Christ had abaſed and humbled himſelfe euen vnto the death, &amp;c. that it had not beene, but to haue left vs a patterne of liuing well, and that our ſaluation conſiſteth not in his death and paſsion, but in the growth and proceeding of our good conuerſation.</hi> Whereupon he is not content to giue him to vnderſtand, that this his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is the ſame which the Apoſtle calleth, the making of the Croſſe of Chriſt of none effect: but taketh his occaſion and proceedeth further; and hauing taken the beaſome once into his hand, he ſweepeth not onely this filth out of the Church, that cauſed him to take it into his hand, but withall he applieth himſelfe all vnder one to ſweepe away, whatſoeuer the Iew, Gentile, Philoſopher, or ſuperſtitious Monke, had brought and ſhuffled thereinto with their vncleane feete, or elſe was negligently loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto, or tolerated by the ſorenamed, it hauing fallen out then, as it doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnto vs now, who are not moued or ſtirred vp to remoue &amp; put away the thing that is euill, be it neuer ſo great. And therefore reprouing the waies that S. Auguſtine did walke in, hee dealeth vpon the true iuſtification in the bloud of Chriſt by faith, more exactly then all the reſt.</p>

Wherein we may note the ſingular goodnes of God towards his Church: for in as much as iuſtification is that point of Chriſtian doctrine which ioyneth man &amp; Chriſt together, which maketh the proper difference of the Church, from all other ſortes of aſſemblies: and of a Chriſtian from all other men, as being that, without which no man can bee a Chriſtian: with which alone well vnderſtood, we retaine both the name and the effect: and to be ſhort, which may bee called by good right, the life of a Chriſtian, the ſoule of the Church, the bond of the mariage betwixt Chriſt and his Church: it was ſurely verie neceſſarie (ſeeing that God according to his promiſe cannot deſtroy his Church:) that this article ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the ſame: that ſuch Eclipſe as ſhould couer the face therof, ſhuld be but ſhort, to the end it might returne vnto his former brightneſſe and light. In a word, (as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ſay, that the heart is the firſt liuing, &amp; laſt dying part in man:) That this heart alſo of the Church, by which it began to liue, (notwithſtanding firſt aſſailed and ſet vpon by the venimous poyſon of Sathan,) was the laſt that was mortally wounded and ſtriken, and the firſt againe recouered: as for certaine it is come to paſſe in our daies, wherein God (making his Goſpell as it were to liue againe, after ſo long a time of death and darkneſſe) would of his incomparable grace, that this point ſhould bee the firſt reſtored into his former eſtate and perfection by them, whome he had raiſed for the reſtauration of his Church.</p>
               <p>Now in this third part we haue entered into the conſideration of the Maſſe,

                     </gap> of that which hath beene ſaid before this third book.</note> in the qualitie of a Sacrifice: ſo it remaineth for our better comming to our ſelues againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long a diſcourſe; that we briefly repeate the ſame, which we meane to performe, in manner as followeth. The Maſſe is properly a corrupting &amp; adulterating of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper of our Lord: and the Supper of our Lord was not ordained for a ſacrifice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his proper ſignification, but for a Sacrament. Neither can it be called a ſacrifice except for that it is a holy action, or elſe becauſe it is a commemoration of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Lord once made vpon the tree of the Croſſe for our ſinnes: or thirdly, for that it is a thankeſgiuing for the benefits receiued by him. Wherefore the Maſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be called a ſacrifice, and much leſſe a propitiatorie ſacrifice: in as much as the whole Scripture, and all antiquitie do teach vs, that there is not in the Church, any moe ſacrifices truely propitiatorie, then one, euen the bloud of our Lord, ſhed for our ſinnes, repreſented and ſhadowed out vnder the Lawe, by all the ſacrifices then in vſe: and fulfilled in the time of grace, in one onely, which ought not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can bee reiterated, without ſacriledge. From this pretended Sacrifice of the Maſſe, haue beene deriued and drawne Maſſes for the deade, through ſuch an
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:15548:216"/>abuſe much like to that which is condemned by diuers auncient Councels, namely, the giuing of the Euchariſt vnto the dead. Withall wee haue ſhewed that there is no Purgatorie: that the old and new Teſtament did neuer acknowledge it, as neither the firſt and moſt auncient antiquitie, if ſo bee they take it not from the heathen: as alſo that thoſe which haue ſpoken of it, did not meane the ſame, which our aduerſaries embrace &amp; maintaine; but rather that this is an opinion, which cannot by any meanes ſtand and agree with that of theirs: and how that hereby Maſſes and Suffrages for the dead, ſwarme vpon the face of the earth. From this pretended ſacrifice likewiſe haue proceeded and ſprung the Maſſes ſaid in honour of Saints, in which they were both praied vnto and worſhipped, yea euen to the offering vp in ſacrifice, in honor of them, of the Sonne of God himſelfe, if one would belieue them. Further wee haue ſhewed that the inuocation and worſhipping of Saints, is condemned throughout the whole Scripture, old and new, and by all true antiquitie: that the beginning of this doting madneſſe, was taken vp by the imitating of the heathens in their Paganiſme; ſhewing further the manifold contradictions, that were maintained againſt the ſame, for a long time: and thus the whole ſeruice of Saints, a great portion of the Papiſts doctrine falleth downe to the ground. And for as much as Inuocation is grounded vppon the merit of Saints, and this Merite oftentimes alleadged in the Maſſe, and that euen in their ſpeaking to God, for the remiſsion of ſinnes; wee haue verified and auoucht it, that there is not any maner of meriting at Gods hand, allowed or taught either in the Scriptures, or in the auncient writers, neither yet in the purer ſort of the new &amp; latter writers; except ſuch as they themſelues are at this day aſhamed of. In ſumme, that there is neither ſacrifice, name, nor merit, which euer ſaued the dead, or which euer was able to preſerue the liuing; but the onely name, merit, and ſacrifice of one onely Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, dead for our ſinnes, and riſen for our iuſtification: To whome with the Father and the holy Ghoſt be honour and glorie, for the riches of his grace eternally, and euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>The Lawe was no ſooner giuen to man, but ſinne inſued thereupon: neither was ſinne ſo ſoone hatched, but that preſently thereupon, man receiued the writ of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſencibly felt the puniſhment thereof: whereupon likewiſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was preached vnto him,
<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> by Gods owne mouth: namely, in the promiſe of the holy ſeede, which ſhould bruiſe the head of the Serpent: and in the incarnation of the Sonne of God, for the redemption of mankind, for the remiſsion of our ſinnes. And this Goſpell is the reconciliation of God with men, by the bloud of our Lord, ſhed effectually before the foundation of the world, in as much as from the ſame, he hath wrought the ſaluation and redemption of the Patriarkes and Prophets: and to bee ſhort of al them which haue bene ſaued either without the Law, or vnder the law: ſhed
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:15548:217"/>notwithſtanding naturally in his appointed and determined time, euen when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hauing taken our fleſh, was ſtretched vpon the tree of the Croſſe for vs.</p>
               <p>Man in the meane time in his blindneſſe and peruerſe nature became vnable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee or belieue this excellent myſterie, if God had not reuealed it vnto him:
<note place="margin">The neceſſity of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> but able on the contrarie, quickly to forget it, according to our ordinarie negligence and careleſneſſe in heauenly things, if it had not beene repreſented and ſet before his eyes continually. And afterward, what apparance or likely-hood could there be conceiued of ſinfull man, vnthankfull to God, and condemned and caſt away in his owne conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; that God would vouchſafe to be his God; that hee would reconcile himſelfe vnto a vile and vnprofitable creature; that hee would make a league with duſt; giue himſelfe to him for a perpetuall inheritance, and deliuer his onely Sonne, to ſuffer a ſhamefull and ignominious death for him? All of them beeing workes of a bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depth of mercie, towards a moſt miſerable creature, who waited and looked for nothing elſe, in the guiltineſſe of his owne conſcience, but a bottomleſſe Sea of wrath and indignation.</p>
               <p>This therefore was the cauſe why God, our Creator, the beginning, middle and end of our ſaluation; not content to haue promiſed and giuen his Sonne to our firſt parents, vnto reconciliation and redemption, and in their perſons vnto their true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, which is the Church, doth renue from time to time this Goſpell vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this glad tidings of the league and couenaunt made with his faithfull ones, for their ſaluation; giuing them ſometimes Prophetes to preach his Chriſt that was to come, and ſometimes Apoſtles, to teſtifie and beare witneſſe vnto him, alreadie come in the fleſh, dead, and riſen for vs. This is the miniſterie of his holy word, euermore continued in his Church. He furthermore ordaineth for them, Sacraments of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, made and accompliſhed; earneſt pence and palpable pledges of the certaintie of his promiſes, teſtimonies of his faithfulnes, and remedies of their diſtruſt and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidencie: which ſpeake and teſtifie outwardly, both vnto their eares and eyes, by the analogie and agreement of their nature, and inwardly to their vnderſtandings and hearts, by the working of the holy Ghoſt accompanying them: namely, that this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant is certaine, that they in particular are comprehended and contained in the ſame, &amp;c. And which more is, they worke within, a faith of the free promiſes of the Creator, of the remiſsion of ſinne in his Sonne, &amp;c. a confirmation of that moſt neere coniunction, that is betwixt the faithfull and God, an vnion with Chriſt, by the bond of his holy ſpirit: ſuch as the members haue with the head, from which they draw ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and life. Whereupon it followeth, that they are made new men, for ſo much as the power and efficacie of the ſpirit of Chriſt, dooth conuert and turne them into his nature, draw them from their owne, regenerate and caſt them anew by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and that both in their affections, as alſo in their actions, to put their truſt in God, through Ieſus Chriſt, to renounce and forſake themſelues, for the loue of him, and to wiſh well and doe well vnto their neighbours, but eſpecially to the members of the ſame bodie, both in him and for him.</p>
               <p>Now therefore this is the office and part of the Sacraments:
<note place="margin">What a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> and thereupon a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to define it properly, is a holy ceremonie inſtituted of God, added to the promiſe of grace made in Ieſus Chriſt; to be an earneſt penie and certaine teſtimonie, vnto all the faithfull, that this promiſe of grace, expounded &amp; explaned in the word of God, is particularly exhibited, ratified &amp; applied to him, vnto ſaluation.

               <p>But ſome man may obiect:
<note place="margin">Wherein our Sacramentes excell.</note> What is then the prerogatiue of a Chriſtian? What is there more in our Sacraments, then in the old? The anſwere is cleare and plaine: the word Propheticall and Apoſtolicall are of one efficacie, Chriſt is in the one and in the other, equall and like vnto himſelfe euerie where: ſo farre as that our Lord ſpeaking of the Propheticall Scriptures, ſaith, <hi>Examine them, for you belieue to haue eternall life in them.</hi> Thus it is with the Sacraments of the old and new people: and notwithſtanding the word and Sacraments of the new, are not without their prerogatiues, not in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in circumſtaunce, not in kind, but in degree. They agree in this, that they ſhew forth, promiſe, ſignifie and exhibite the ſame communion of Chriſt, by faith and the holy Ghoſt, by the which the elect, ſince the time of Adam, euen to the laſt man vpon the earth, are to be ſaued. For without this communion, there was no ſaluation, either in the old or new people. They differ, for that vnder the old Teſtament, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had this communion in Chriſt to come; and therefore the worke of grace was the more obſcure vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but we haue it in Chriſt come in the fleſh, &amp;c. and therfore the ſame grace more bright &amp; cleare. Againe, they agree, in that they ſeale vp ſaluation
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:15548:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>and grace to all them in generall, that doe receiue them in faith: They differ herein, that the old ones were not properly ordained, but for the poſteritie of Abraham: but theſe latter and new ones, for all the nations vppon the face of the earth, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the Church, and in the Communion of Chriſt, in the faith of Abraham. To be ſhort, they agree, in that they ſeale vp vnto vs the couenant with the ſame God, through the ſame Chriſt, for the ſame reconciliation; whereupon followeth the ſame fruite, euen the remiſsion of ſinnes and eternall life: They differ in this, that God which hath of old ſpoken by his Prophets, hath now vouchſafed to ſpeake by his own Sonne; in ſo much, that wee may ſay with Saint Iohn: <hi>That that which was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the word of life, we haue heard with our eares, ſeene with our eyes, and touched with our hands, &amp;c.</hi> And wee haue alſo greater helpes, to raiſe our faith vnto a further aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of grace, by how much the accompliſhment is more then the promiſe; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of him in the fleſh, of more efficacie to moue vs, then the expectation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and for that amongſt the ſences, one is more quicke and certainely prouing then the other; and that which is perceiued many waies more perſwaſiue, then that which is comprehended but one way: and that which is knowne of the goodneſſe of God, in the ſending of his Sonne crucified before our eyes, more ſtrong to beget in vs an aſſuredneſſe of his mercie, and by conſequent of his loue towards vs, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning with him, then that which hee had ſpoken vnto vs by his Prophets, or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his ſacrifices in all the times that went before. And yet in the meane time the old Sacraments ceaſe not to be figures of ours, as Circumciſion, of Baptiſme; and the Paſſe-ouer, of the holy Supper. But certainely, antitypes rather then types, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent figures, not bare and naked figures; figures, which contained the verie ſame thing, although not in the ſame manner, although not in the ſame degree of cleareneſſe and ampleneſſe.

Wee ſhall ſay the ſame of the Paſſe-ouer, and of the holy Supper. In the one and in the other are ſignified the offering vp of our Lord vpon the Croſſe, and the ſhedding of his bloud for our ſinnes: but in the Paſſe-ouer, ſuch ſacrifice and ſhedding to be done, in the holy Supper ſuch ſacrifice, and ſhedding of bloud alreadie done. Both in the one and the other, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and drunke the bodie and bloud of our Lord: in the one the thing giuen with the figure, no leſſe then in the other the figure giuen with the thing. And euerie where it is ſpoken of by the tearmes of eating and drinking: and euerie where by the name of celebrating a memoriall: as alſo euerie where by the name of a Teſtament and of a
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:15548:220"/>couenant made in bloud: So farre foorth as that Saint Paul calleth the meate of the one and the other, the ſame meate. The fathers our Supper, by the name of Paſſe-ouer; and the Iewes Paſſe-ouer, by the name of Supper. The difference is, that the true Lambe hath beene crucified, which was to bee crucified; whereupon our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the more cleare and plaine: giuen for the ſinnes of the world, and not of the poſteritie of Abraham onely, and hereby alſo it is the more famous and renowned. Finally ordained to be continued, euen till the comming of the Lord, and therefore permanent and vnchangable.</p>
               <p>This is that which Saint Auguſtine ſaith:

And notwithſtanding the ſpirit of God is ſhed forth more aboundantly in the new Teſtament, then in the old, in as much as the ſpring-head and fountaine is broken forth by the comming of the Lord, vpon all people (whereas it was hidden or ſealed vp for the moſt part;) that they themſelues to whome it is opened, may draw out thereof aboundantly; in as much as of a more cleare knowledge, ſpringeth a more powerfull faith; and faith is the hand and veſſell, by which we receiue the graces of God, whereof wee draw out of this fountaine, and that more mightily and aboundantly, according to the meaſure of our knowledge and faith.</p>
               <p>We haue handled this matter ſomewhat the more largely, becauſe that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the matter we haue in hand, dependeth in part on this propoſition: for the better vnderſtanding wherof we haue alſo to preſuppoſe certaine other Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, held of the auncient writers which doe follow. And this ſhall ſtand for the firſt, <hi>That Chriſt is the ſubſtance of all the Sacraments, as well of the old as of the new Teſtament; and that in them he was receiued, yea drunken and eaten, that is to ſay, moſt neerely communicated, as the Apoſtle hath told vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, that they teach vs. is; that the ſame Chriſt which is receiued in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,

               <p>The third, that euerie Sacrament conſiſteth in three things: in the ſigne,

The ſigne which is viſible: the thing, that is to ſay, grace, which is inuiſible, the operation of the worde, and of the ſpirit, incomprehenſible.

And this thing alſo we ſhall be throughly inſtructed in by the fathers. S.

And Saint Bernard intreating vpon this matter, giueth vs an example. <hi>A Sacrament,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is a ſacred ſigne. A Iewell may be giuen onely for a Iewell: but it may bee giuen alſo to inuest and ſet a man in poſſeſsion of an inheritance.

And thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our Lord drawing neere his death, had care to inueſt his elect, and put them in poſſeſsion of his grace: for which cauſe this inuiſible grace was giuen vnto them by ſome viſible ſigne, &amp;c.</hi> Where we are to obſerue, that the worde, pledge, and the ſimilitude of the Iewell, or ring, are of antiquitie. And this for our definition. That which we call the ſigne, the fathers do ſometimes call the Sacrament: how ſoeuer ordinarily this whole holy action is ſo called: As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay, <hi>That the Sacrament is diuerſe and differing from the thing of the Sacrament,</hi> that is to ſay, that the thing is one, and the Sacrament of the ſame another: that is to ſay again, that the ſigne is one thing, and the grace which is the thing ſignified, is an other. <hi>The figure is one thing,</hi> (ſaith Tertullian) <hi>but the thing of the figure another. The figure is one thing</hi> (ſaith Saint Hillarie) <hi>and the truth another. The figure that which is ſeene without, the truth is that which is belieued within. The ſenſible thing</hi> (ſaith Saint Chryſoſtome) <hi>is one thing, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible another. The Sacrament</hi> (ſaith ſaint Auguſtine) <hi>is one thing, and the power of the Sacrament another. The Sacrament of the thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is that which ſome take &amp; receiue to life, others to deſtruction. The thing, that is to ſay, grace, whereof the Sacrament becommeth a Sacrament, that is to ſay, a ſigne, that no man doth communicate to his ruine and destruction, but euerie man to life and ſaluation.</hi> And hereof we haue examples.

And indeed, none of the fathers euer ſaid, that Manna was conuerted and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fleſh of Chriſt: or the water of the rocke, yea the water of Baptiſme, into his bloud: notwithſtanding that Saint Paul hath ſaid: That our fathers did eate the ſame meate, and drinke the ſame drinke that we, that is to ſay, Chriſt: That the firſt of the olde writers haue acknowledged that the true Iſraelites did eate the fleſh of Chriſt in their Manna, and drunke his bloud in the rocke: That wee all agree togither, that in Baptiſme we are waſhed from our ſinnes in the bloud of Chriſt, no leſſe truly then our bodies are waſhed with water.

<note place="margin">The difference betwixt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> do call the Sacraments Myſteries and not Miracles. In diuine Myſteries, the grace of God is hidden: in Miracles, it is manifeſted and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Miracles are wrought to moue the vnbeleeuers, to conuince them in their owne vnderſtanding, and (verie often) to leaue them vnexcuſable, through the clearnes and euidentnes thereof: Myſteries are reſerued for the faithfull, at leaſt for thoſe that are reputed ſuch, to ſeal vp vnto them their ſaluation, to ſtir vp their faith, &amp; to raiſe them from natural ſenſe and vnderſtanding to the ſpirit; from an opinion to faith; and from the earth vnto heauen, &amp;c. And therfore we ſee not, that euer the Scripture doth lead vs to obſerue and marke any miracles in the ſignes of his Myſteries, notwithſtanding that it is a dutie to be moſt carefully diſcharged, to publiſh &amp; ſet forth the maruailous works of the Lord in the church. It teacheth vs the famous and worthie paſsing of the deſtroying Angell ouer the houſes of the Iſraelits, without touching of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So likewiſe of Manna, &amp; the rock: in that the one was rained, &amp; the other diſſolued into water, it is a miracle: but in that they feed &amp; que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch the thirſt of the true Iſraelits ſpiritually, there lies a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.

And by that meanes wee receiue not onely Chriſt, really and ſubſtantially in the holy Supper, celebrated according to his inſtitution, but we are wrought into one bodie, more and more amongſt our ſelues, of which body he is the head, and we the members: the faithfull I meane, that draw their ſpirituall life, the ſenſe, motion and ſpirituall action of their ſoules from him, a liuely and quickened body by his ſpirit, one togither by him, one by his grace, with him.

Neither haue the ancient fathers otherwiſe vnderſtoode this communicating of Chriſt. Saint Cyprian; <hi>Our coniunction with Chriſt doth not make any mixture of perſons,
<note place="margin">According to the old writers Cypr. de Caen.

He had ſaid, that if wee eate not his fleſh, &amp;c. we ſhall not haue life in him. Teaching vs by a ſpirituall inſtruction, and opening vnto vs the ſpirit, to the conceyuing of ſo hidde and ſecret a thing, to the ende that wee might know, that our abiding in him, is an eating of him: and our incorporating into him, a drinking of him. And all this is wrought by our ſubmitting of our ſelues in obedience, ioyning of our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in will, and vniting of our ſelues vnto him in our affections. Wherefore the eating of this fleſh, is a greedineſſe, or a feruent deſire to abide and dwell in him. As by eating, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the ſubſtaunce of the bodie liueth and is nouriſhed: euen ſo the life of the ſpirit is nouriſhed by this proper nouriſhment. For looke what eating is vnto the bodie, the ſame is faith vnto the ſoule.

<note place="margin">Auguſt. Ep. ad Iren. De Conſecr. D. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is the bread, whereof who ſo eateth, liueth eternally: and whereof hee hath ſaide: And the bread which I will giue, is my fleſh, which I will giue for the life of the worlde. Hee determineth and ſetteth downe howe hee is bread; not onely according to the worde, by the which all thinges liue: but according to the fleſh, taken for the life of the worlde. For man which was dead in ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnited and made one with the fleſhe which is pure and vndefiled, and incorporated into the ſame, doth liue by the ſpirit of Christ, as a bodie liueth by his ſoule: but he that is not of the body of Chriſt, doth not liue by his ſpirit, &amp;c.

               <p>Thus,
<note place="margin">Theſe words, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> cannot bee interpreted without a figure.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> according to their ſence and conſtruction, what ſhall it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie? <hi>Hoc, this;</hi> If it be meant of the bread, then it muſt be thus taken: <hi>This bread is my bodie.</hi> But this is not their meaning: for they confeſſe that it cannot bee two ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at one and the ſame inſtant. And when two chiefe and primarie ſubſtances, that is to ſay, two Iudiuidua, as the Logicians call them, are called the one by the name of the other, there muſt of neceſsitie be included a figure: but this they wil not yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Furthermore they doe not pretend that it is the body vntill the laſt word be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and wee are as yet but in the verie firſt. And in the meane time then, ſhall it not be the ſame which our Lord tooke, bleſſed, brake, and gaue to his Diſciples, that is to ſay, bread? What ſhall then this <hi>hoc</hi> make? The accidents of bread without the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, namely, whiteneſſe, roundneſſe, &amp;c? And what manner of ſpeech were it to ſay? The accidents of bread are my body, which is giuen for you: or elſe their <hi>Indiuiduum vagum, and vage determinatum: This I cannot tell what, in the ayre, which they can neither name nor point out ſo as that it may be comprehended:</hi> How it may bee bread in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the vttering of the words, and his body in the end. What a number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and ſtraunge figures: to how many contradictorie deſignments and deuiſes are they driuen, and all to auoide one cleare and manifeſt figure, and that ſuch a one as is verie often and familiarly vſed in the Sacraments? Afterward, <hi>This is my bloud.</hi> What
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:15548:225"/>ſhalbe the meaning of this <hi>Hoc</hi> in this place? It is ſaid, that taking the cup, he bleſſed it and ſaid; <hi>Drinke ye all, Bibite ex hoc omnes.</hi> This <hi>Hoc</hi> then is the cup whereof he ſaith, <hi>This is my bloud.</hi> But can it poſſibly be, that the cup ſhould be called blood without a figure? ſeeing that according to their owne aſſertions, it is the wine and not the cup? It followeth, <hi>Eſt:</hi> This is (ſay they) a verbe ſubſtantiue. Let it bee granted, but is it therefore a verbe tranſubſtantiue? <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>This is made my bodie:</hi> It is ſubſtantially turned, it is tranſubſtantiated into my bodie and bloud? This is their meaning, and they call this word in their affected tearmes and gibberidge, an <hi>operatiue and practicke Eſt.</hi> But if it be vnderſtood of the bread, then what figure is it? And how will their fond deuiſed fantaſie ſtand, ſith they hold, that the bread is not changed or turned, but becommeth nothing, to the end it may giue place to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die? And what ſhew of any figure will there then be here? <hi>Hoc eſt, that is to ſay, this Vagum Indiuiduum, which hath no name, is tranſubſtantiated into his bodie.</hi> And if it bee wandring and vnſtable, it is not <gap reason="foreign">

And of the cup particularly, without acknowledging that it is tranſubſtantiated? But this they do not admit. Let vs proceed: <hi>Take, eate,</hi> but what? Accidents? but they are no proper obiects for the teeth to be occupied about. The bodie of Chriſt then? But as they ſay themſelues, it is not as yet there. And then it is not chewed there, it is not there broken. What ſhall then the meaning bee of this word eate? But to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to eate, to make ſemblance of eating? &amp;c. But how much better had it been to haue expounded this place by the nature of other Sacraments? whereof it is ſaid: <hi>This is my couenant:</hi> as here, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood; This is the blood of the new Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> all comming to the ſame ſence. Againe, <hi>The rocke was Chriſt, I am the bread of life:</hi> as here, <hi>The bread is my bodie, the cup is my blood.</hi> To expound it I ſay by Ieſus Chriſt in S. Iohn: <hi>My fleſh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede:</hi> Where in plaine tearmes he referreth vs vnto his death, when hee ſaith: <hi>Which I will giue for the life of the world:</hi> As alſo here, <hi>Which is giuen, which is ſhed for you.</hi> But, ſaith he to the Capernaites; <hi>The words that J ſay vnto you are ſpirite and life.</hi> And therefore ſome are of iudgement, that this whole ſpeech of his was nothing elſe but a reſolued and purpoſed Commentarie, and a preparatiue to the right vnderſtanding of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupper. And finally to haue expounded it by Saint Paule: <hi>Who giueth vnto vs, that which he had receiued of the Lord.</hi> But what? Accidents? No, but bread; <hi>As oft</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as you ſhall eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cup, &amp;c.</hi> And he goeth ouer this word bread fiue times, and that after the words of Conſecration as they call them: and yet notwithſtanding, <hi>The body of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> For, <hi>Whoſoeuer eateth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of this bread vnworthily, eateth his iudgement, is culpable of the body and bloud of our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> As if a man ſhould ſay, <hi>Reus Maieſtatis, guiltie of high treaſon againſt the body of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he hath abuſed his Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnto death, which were ordained for him vnto life.

Roundneſſe, whiteneſſe, moyſtneſſe, and redneſſe, which they giue vs for ſignes, what analogie haue they with the ſpirituall nouriſhment? Or the accidents with the ſubſtance? And in ſtead of deeper and deeper ſetling vs in faith: what is it that they are able to beget in vs but new forged opinions, and vaine fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies?

               <p>In the ſecond place,

What iniurie then and wrong dooth Tranſubſtantiation offer vnto our Lord, vnto this precious pearle of the Goſpell, which giueth the ſame to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and vnbelieuers, which caſteth the ſame to Dogges and Swine, in ſuch ſort as that they regard or looke after nothing elſe, but that they haue a mouth to caſt it into, and a ſtomacke to ſwallow it downe into? Can theſe courſes bee maintained ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſcriptures, or yet by the old church? wee ſay of euery Sacrament, that the ſigne which is called ordinarily the Sacrament, may be receiued of all, but the thing
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:15548:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Sacrament, <hi>res Sacramenti,</hi> of the faithfull and beleeuers onely. And as for that due regard and conſideration which is to be had of the holie Supper, the word of the ſonne of God, is expreſlie laide downe concerning the ſame. <hi>This is my bodie which is giuen for you, my bloud which is ſhed for your ſins.</hi> He giueth them not for meat and food, but to ſuch as for whome it is ſhed, as for whom it is broken, that is to ſay, which are effectually redeemed, and by conſequent his members. And thus ſaith Origen;

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrarie, it ſhould proue moſt plain and manifeſt, that if their opinion take place, that the vnbeleeuers and hypocrites ſhall receiue the bodie of Chriſt, Chriſt ſhal dwell in their bodies corporally ſuch as are dead in their ſinnes, ſhal receiue the bread of life, and in it eternal life? Thus then they deſtroy the Sacrament of the Supper, both in the thing, and in the ſigne, proſtituting holineſſe and ſanctimonie, vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, caſting the childrens bread vnto dogges; and beſtowing the ſpiritual life vpon the vnbeleeuers. In the ſignes cauſing them to ceaſe to be ſubſtances, and ſignes of a moſt ſubſtantiall ſubſtance, turning them into vaine and imaginarie accidents: acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſubſiſting without any ſubiect, and yet hauing taſte, and apt to feed and ſuſtaine, and to beget excrements and wormes, that is to ſay, ſubſtances: yea and to be turned into aſhes, that is to ſay into matter; (doe we conſent and agree vnto the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contained in theſe things?) yea and to be bruſed and broken in peeces. For if this be not bread which is broken, ſhall it be the bodie? They are not able to affirme it:
<note place="margin">Iohn 19. Exod. 12.</note> The ſcripture is verie cleare and plaine: <hi>His bones ſhall not be broken.</hi> Thus then you ſee how they go about to make them accidents without any bodie.</p>

Our aduerſaries cannot conceiue, how he ſhould feede their ſoules, if he come not nie vnto their bodies, if he be not in their mouthes: And how doth the Sunne, which is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bring forth, quicken, heat and inlighten things, and that ſo far off? And he which feedeth vs in S. Iohn, without Sacraments, &amp; without ſignes,

Seeing they afford reliefe &amp; helpe for the vnderpropping of our infirmity, not diminiſhing or any thing impairing his power? and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth continually in the hearts of his children: why ſhould he not manifeſt the ſame on ſome one day more plainely and plentifully? Seeing it is hee for certaine which hath ordained it, &amp; ſeeing alſo that his lodging is therein the better prepared, by our faith by our zeale, and by our repentance.

                  <hi>To the ende that no man ſhould deceiue himſelfe, in going about to adore the Head in heauen, and to trample vpon his feet here on earth, he hath declared and told where his members be: The Head being to aſcend vp into heauen, hath recommended vnto vs his members here on earth and ſo is departed and gone hence, &amp;c.

And where is the word? where is the promiſe? And what maketh the Sacrament but the word? Wherby are we made partakers of the fruit and effect but by the promiſe? If we receiue not the ſame thing that the Apoſtles receiued, &amp; after the ſame maner, to what end then ſhold theſe words of the Lord: <hi>Doe this, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo thoſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>I haue receiued of the Lord, that which I haue giuen vnto you,</hi> ſerue?

Then he addeth; <hi>For this is the ſame with the walking of his body vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea, without being chaunged; for euen ſo without any manner of change in his bodie, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in at the dores being ſhut. And therefore he would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that his diſciples ſhould touch him, to the end that they might know, that he entred not by changing of his bodie into a spirite, but that by diuine power, which bringeth thinges to paſſe, beyond the courſe of nature, this bodie of his conſiſting of groſſe parts, was entered and come into them.</hi> Saint Cyrill: <hi>The Lord went in to his diſciples the dores being ſhut: and that by ſurpaſsing (through his omnipotencie) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things. And therefore let no man trouble himſelf with ſeeking out of the cauſe, but let him rather conſider that the queſtion is not here of a meere man, like to our ſelues: but of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Sonne of God, to whome whole nature is ſubiect. This was therefore after the ſame manner, that his walking vpon the ſea was, which naturally is not giuen to beare vp our feet,</hi> (and note that this was before his bodie was glorified) <hi>and therefore when thou readeſt this, beware that thou be not turned aſide, to forſake the true faith, &amp;c. And if thou bee not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſame, blame the defects and wantes of thy spirit: and ſay rather: That whereas hee thus entred in at the dores being ſhut, it is becauſe he is God: and yet not any other then he was at the time of his being conuerſant as men amongst his diſciples before his paſsion.</hi> And in deed the better ſort of their expoſitors of the later writers do not abuſe theſe places, to the prouing of the ſaid pearſing through of dimenſions, imagined and deuiſed by our aduerſaries, which maketh that two bodies ſhould occupie but one place. <hi>The dores</hi> (ſay they) <hi>were opened:

And in the ſecond place: That this Maxime abideth euer firme; that in God there is not yea and no toge ther: and therefore that no miracle how great ſoeuer can imply any contradiction. For the one S.

<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Trinit. li. 5. c. 10</note> &amp; that they may be reuerenced as religious things; but that they ought not to worke any admiration in vs, as if they were miracles.</hi> And by name, he ſpeaketh there of the holy ſupper: As in deede there was neuer any miracle read of, whoſe effectes were not cleare and manifeſt to the ſences. And to the ſecond S. Thomas telleth vs: <hi>God is not Almightie in respect of the things wherein there is contradiction, becauſe that they cannot be accounted of as poſsible things.</hi>

And thus then they deſtroy the humane nature of Chriſt, wherein lyeth the principall conſolation of mankind; the article alſo of his aſcention into heauen, of his ſitting at the right hand, &amp;c. that is to ſay, euen our Creed.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt place, let vs ſee how they deale with his diuinitie.
<note place="margin">Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature of the Sonne of God.</note> It is a rule amongſt all the ancient fathers, as we haue ſeene; that men ſhould diſtribute the Sacraments, that is to ſay, the ſignes: but that God alone is the giuer of the thing, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this, wherein it pleaſeth the Sonne of God to giue himſelfe vnto vs, his fleſh and his blood for our nouriſhment vnto eternall life. But with what reuerence can we ſay, that another giueth it vs, and that in ſuch ſort, as that it dependeth not vpon the inſtitution of the Sacrament in it ſelfe, neither yet of the vertue of the wordes which they call ſacramentall: but (as in the workes and feates of Magicke, in which ſtrong imagination worketh the effect) of the intention of the prieſt which vttereth them? Whereupon it followeth, that God muſt needs haue tyed his grace to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the confecrating prieſt: and not to his owne inſtitution, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his holy ſpirit? And the Sonne of God ſhall not be ours, that is to ſay, the life which is in him ſhall not diſtribute it ſelfe vnto the faithfull, further then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of this intention ſhall extend? And it ſhall bee in the power, or rather in the weaknes of the Prieſt, to fruſtrate and ſend away emptie, a whole aſſemblie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Chriſtians, gathered together in the name of Chriſt, feruently deſiring in a true faith, and longing after his grace, which hee hath included in this precious gift, which he hath vouchſafed freely to beſtow vpon them of himſelf, in ſtead that he hath ſo graciouſly declared his good will vnto vs ſaying: <hi>When two or three of you ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if he be nothing bent that way, then according to their doctrine, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrateth not, neither is the Sonne of God communicated. And neuertheleſſe if he do conſecrate, yet they doe not communicate therein, for they are alwaies ſubiect to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:15548:231"/>doubt whether hee had any purpoſe and intention, or not. And whereas there is doubting, there is no faith: and where there is no faith, there is nothing but ſinne. Now themſelues are of this iudgement, that hee cannot receiue the bodie of Chriſt, which doth not belieue in him. Now then what priuiledge hath the vertuous and godly man more then the wicked, ſeeing that the intention or not intention of the Prieſt, tranſubſtantiateth or leaueth vntranſubſtantiated; ſeeing that both the one &amp; the other are ſubiect to doubt of the intention, &amp; therefore of the effect; &amp; ſeeing that both the one and the other, whether doubting or aſſured thereof, do equally receiue or not receiue? Likewiſe what ſhall become of their doctrine, <hi>De opere operato;</hi> That the thing profiteth and is auaileable, in aſmuch as it is onely performed and done; &amp; not in regard of the perſon which doth it, ſeeing that this whole myſterie dependeth now, <hi>Ex opere operantis, of the working and operation of the ſacrificer?</hi> Moreouer, where ſhall the excellencie of this Sacrament aboue all other Sacraments bee found: if the reſt depend vppon the grace of God, without any ſuch neceſſitie of the intention of him that conſecrateth: as the greateſt part of them doth hold of baptiſme, and of that pretended Sacrament of mariage? &amp;c. On God I ſay, whoſe intention and purpoſe neuer halteth or faileth, neither yet by conſequent, the obiect of our faith: the ſame (not to ſpeake any thing more ſharpely and grieuouſly of the infirmity of man) being ſubiect to faile euerie moment? But further I would know what ſhal become of their priuate Maſſes:
<note place="margin">Bonauent. in Comp. Sacr. Theol. rubr. 11. l. 8. Gabr. Biel. lect. 6. lit.

But Hugo and Biel &amp; the moſt part of the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are they not of iudgement, that priuate Maſſe, wherein there is no publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance made of the death of Chriſt, doth nothing at all agree with the mind of the inſtitutor? what conſolation then can they of the Church of Rome haue in the Sacrament, when in ſtead of nouriſhing of their faith, they maintaine and feed doubt and vncertaintie: when as after they haue beene well prepared, they know not what they receiue: the efficacie of the conſecration being vnable to penetrate and pearce according to their doctrine in the Sacrament, without this intention and purpoſe: the man likewiſe not being able to pearce and ſee into the intent of the conſecrating Prieſt by any meanes? Thus in ſeeking to giue too much to the worthineſſe of the Prieſt, they haue taken away the effect of the Sacrament from God, who onely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſame: and from the people the profit and fruit which ſhould come to them thereby,
<note place="margin">Stella clericoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and for which it was ordained. And all this, that they might be honoured in the diſpenſation of the myſteries of God, more then God himſelfe, more then the Creator: whoſe Creators and makers, ſince the time of the entring of the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, they haue not beene aſhamed to profeſſe themſelues to be. Now the old Church had neuer any ſuch doctrine: they did not at any time once thinke of calling of Chriſt out of heauen by multitude of wordes:
<note place="margin">What is meant by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</note> they did attribute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the bodie of Chriſt, to the inſtitution of our Lord, to the operation of the holy Ghoſt, and to the faith of the faithfull. To conſecrate in their language was to ſanctifie that is, to bleſſe: that is, to change a thing from the common vſe, to a holy: and from a profane, to a ſacred: which is accompliſhed by the word, that is to ſay, by the inſtitution of the Lord, which giueth it his efficacie. Thus ſpeaketh Saint Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ordinarily: <hi>That the bread and the wine of the holy Supper are ſanctified by the word.</hi> And S.

For notwithſtanding that he ſpeake here of the ſpirituall, yet he ceaſeth not to declare vnto vs the maner of the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, to wit, vnder the Sacraments, the obiectes of our ſences, the helpes of our faith, &amp; yet ſpiritual. And thus haue the ancient fathers euermore vnderſtood it, &amp; haue ſerued themſelues with this place of S. Iohn, as a Commentarie vpon the reſt of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; which haue collected and gathered the neceſſitie of the expounding thereof ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely: alſo that the faithfull alone are partakers of the thing of the Sacrament and not the wicked and vngodly. But as the authors of tranſubſtantiation did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more and more embrace the carnall preſence, &amp; conſequently, that the wicked and vngodly did eate Chriſt, ſo began they leſſe and leſſe to admit in this matter and queſtion, the authoritie of this ſermon made by our Lorde: a ſermon verily made ſome yeare or thereabout before the inſtitution of the Supper: but as is manifeſt, an intended preparatiue vnto the ſame: euen as the talke and communication which our Lord had with Nicodemus concerning baptiſme, was a preparatiue to Baptiſme. There our Lord ſaid:
<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man be not regenerate, that is to ſay, borne againe, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> And here: <hi>Jf a man eate not my fleſh and drinke my bloud, hee can not haue life in him, &amp;c.</hi> There Nicodemus was offended: <hi>And how can a man that is old be borne againe, can he enter into his mothers bellie, &amp;c.</hi> And here the Capernaites: <hi>This is a harſh ſpeech who can endure to heare it?

And there hee expoundeth his meaning to Nicodemus: <hi>Man muſt bee borne againe of water and of the spirite: That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is borne of the ſpirit is spirit, &amp;c.</hi> And here in like manner to the Capernaites: <hi>It is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that quickneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing, &amp;c.</hi> Now Baptiſme was formally inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the ſpeech had by Chriſt with Nicodemus: the ſigne added to the thing, the water to the ſpirit. &amp;c. and yet notwithſtanding the water did not change his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This text likewiſe ſerueth not a little to the plaine laying out of the doctrine of baptiſme. And in like manner after the ſermon of our Lord to the Capernaites, the holy ſupper was inſtituted, the elements of corporall nouriſhment, ordained for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the ſpiritual, &amp;c. And then why ſhould theſe ſignes change their natures? And why ſhall it not be lawful to alleadge this place, as well in the matter of the Lords ſupper, for the cleerer vnderſtanding of the ſame, that ſo we may be enlightned, and made to diſcerne where our ſpirituall nouriſhment lyeth? And ſeeing that the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of baptiſme comming after, hath not at all made regeneration to be carnall, by the adding of the element therunto: why ſhould the putting of the element to the eating and ſpirituall communicating of Chriſt haue made it carnall?</p>

                     </gap>, The meate of the Lord,</hi> the Euchariſt; and <hi>by abiding or dwelling naturally in vs,</hi> to receiue the bodie of Chriſt really at our mouthes. And theſe are the points which we are to examine. Saint Hillarie dealeth here againſt the Arrians: <hi>The Father</hi> (ſaith S. Hillarie) <hi>and the Sonne are one.</hi> Euen ſo ſaid they, but yet ſo one, as we are one with Chriſt. Now that we are one with Chriſt, it is of his free will, not of our nature: and in will, not in nature, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne are alſo one. Saint Hillarie then to proue vnto them, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne were one in nature; proueth vnto them that we are one in nature with Chriſt: and he handleth it after this ſort: Firſt, that there is the ſame humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt and in vs, by the incarnation of the Sonne of God, which he calleth the Sacrament of perfect vnitie, the Sacrament of fleſh and bloud; and by which, <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis communionis propriet as nobis indulgetur, The propertie of the naturall communion is giuen vnto vs by our Lord:</hi> Vſing the word Sacrament, for the <hi>Myſterie</hi> in the worke of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; as it is his ordinarie vſe to doe: a manner of ſpeech, verie familiar at that time, as we reade in the conference betwixt the Catholiks and Donatiſts; where Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celline, who did ſit as Preſident and chiefe Iudge for the Emperour Honorius, doth ſweare, <hi>By the miſterie of the Trinitie, and by the Sacrament of the Lords incarnation, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond place; that beſides this nature, which the faithfull and vnfaithfull are alike partakers of with our Lord, there is a ſpecial and more particular coniunction, which is wrought by the ſpirit of Chriſt dwelling in the faithfull, which regenerateth, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſanctifieth, maketh them conformable vnto him, and transformeth them into him: for proofe whereof he alleadgeth the 6.14. and 17. of S. Iohn, which our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will not denie to belong to the ſpirituall eating of the faithfull onely. And this he maketh more cleare when hee addeth; that the cauſe of our life, is by Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling naturally in vs, by his fleſhe vniting vs vnto himſelfe, and by himſelfe vnto God the father: That Chriſt is in vs, by the truth of his nature: that hee dwelleth in vs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, we being made by this moſt ſtrait bond of vnion, fleſh of his fleſh, ſucking our life from his ſpirit. And this he further declareth by ſundrie ſorts of ſpeeches, tending all to one ſence and meaning: <hi>That we communicate his fleſh: To mingle in vs the nature of his fleſh: To be naturally in vs and we in him.</hi> And this our aduerſaries themſelues wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it cannot be ſaid of the vngodly, and by conſequent that it cannot apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Sacramentall or orall eating, that is to ſay, to the eating of the mouth. Ad hereunto: that he which ſaith, that he is naturally in vs, ſaith alſo;
<note place="margin">Hilar. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. l. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>That we are naturally in him.</hi> But naturally we are not in him, as being in him carnally or really, but as graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by faith into his body: ſo neither is Chriſt by this argument, carnally and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in vs. Thirdly he alleadgeth vnto vs as a teſtimonie of his holy vnion, the ſupper of our Lord when he ſaith, that we receiue verily and truely the word fleſh, <hi>Cibo Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico, By the meate of the Lord,</hi> that is to ſay, the fleſh of the word, the word incarnate, the fleſh of the Sonne of God, by the inſtrument of the bread of the Euchariſt, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Sacrament exhibiting this fleſh, exhibiting the grace repreſented by the ſigne, which conſiſteth in this vniting of vs with Chriſt. The ſame which he calleth, <hi>Sub myſterio, Christi carnem ſumere, To receiue the fleſh of Chriſt in a misterie;</hi> that is to ſay, ſignified in this miſticall pledge. And thus all this maketh nothing for the matter of bread, or the Indiuiduum vagum, tranſubſtantiated into the body: For otherwiſe it would fall out that throughout all Saint Hillarie his diſcourſe, Chriſt ſhould be auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and taught to abide in the bread naturally and corporally. And if corporally and naturally; then verily contrarie to the nature and properties of a body; yea contrarie
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:15548:237"/>to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of thoſe which S. Hillarie acknowledgeth to be in the body of Chriſt. For ſaith he in an other place: <hi>He taketh away the fooliſh &amp; ſottiſh raſhneſſe of ſome, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that our Lord was ſeene in the fleſh,

<note place="margin">Idem in Ioh. l. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee are vnited and made one with God the Father, by the mediation of our Sautour: for wee receiue corporally and ſubſtantially the Sonne of God, naturally vnited to the Father; and thus we are glorified, beeing made partakers of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme nature, &amp;c.</hi> which is properly ſpoken of the incarnation, which he calleth a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie; as S. Hillarie a Sacrament. And withall let them not diſſemble and paſſe ouer S. Cyril his Expoſition vpon this ſentence: <hi>I am the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine and you are the braunches:</hi> which is in ſuch ſort as S. Hillarie hath expounded it before, and to the ſame ſence: That the drift that Cyril ſhoteth at is very cleare and euident to them that will reade the place: And that as to be vnited to Chriſt according to the ſpirit, is to haue the ſpirit of Chriſt regenerating his: ſo to be corporally vnited vnto him, or according to the body, is to bee ioyned to his body, and to become members of his body, made conformable to him in this life, by the beginning of ſanctification, and ſpirituall life, waiting and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending till we bee perfected in him, that is to ſay, glorified in the celeſtiall life. Now ſaith hee, this vnion is made by faith, and cheriſhed and ſtrengthned by the eating of his fleſh, and drinking of his bloud: and that he that eateth and drinketh them, is in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him, &amp;c. Hee vnderſtandeth then that this corporall and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall vnion is wrought by a ſpirituall eating, by that pure and exquiſite faith, which he requireth: and not by the corporall, which is common to vs with many drie &amp; rotten members, euen the vngodly &amp; infidels, of whom it cannot be ſaid, that Chriſt is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or they in Chriſt. And in deed he hath ther to deale againſt heretiks, which pretended Chriſt was not called <hi>a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine,</hi> according to his humanitie, but according to his deitie:
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:15548:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>He holding on the contrarie: that the faithfull are made partakers of the nature of Chriſt, as the braunches doe communicate with the Vine, by the participation of his ſpirit,

And this is that which he ſaith: <hi>That they are faſtned to Chriſt, as the braunches to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine, firmely and ſubſtantially ioyned and glued to him by his ſpirit: That they are made braunches, in as much as they are regenerate, and in as much as the roote doth impart vnto them his qualities: They bring foorth fruit, in as much as they hang vppon the Vine, ioyned to the ſame by faith and holineſſe,

So that in Cyrill to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally ioyned, is not after the manner as they are wont vſually to take it in the Schooles, Ratione modi, ſed ratione obiecti, that is to ſay to bee conioyned by the meanes of the body, but to be ioyned to the body. And in deed he declareth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction by a place in the Corinthians, where the faithfull are called the members of Chriſt, that is to ſay, inſeparably ioyned to the body of Chriſt: and not verily by the body, but ſaith he, by the mediation of his ſpirit: As alſo by that place of Saint Iohn, where wee agree, and are of iudgement, that it is ſpoken of the ſpirituall eating and not of the corporall. But I would intreate the Reader, to reade the whole place, that hee may the better iudge of counterfeited and cloaked dealing. They obiect in the meane time the Synod of Epheſus, wherein Cyrill was preſident: <hi>We come</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>vnto the miſticall bleſsings, and are ſanctified, being made partakers of the holy body and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c. not receiuing it as a common fleſh, which God forbid, neither yet as the fleſh of a ſanctified man, &amp;c. but as that which is become the verie fleſh of the word, or eternall Sonne of God.</hi> And who would haue them to doubt of this? But the queſtion is not of the obiect of our Communion, but of the manner. And behold thus he expoundeth it: <hi>When</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>they had heard: If you eate not my fleſh, &amp;c. they were troubled, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they had not as yet bene made acquainted with the forme and moſt goodly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this miſterie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem in Ioh. l. 12. c 58.</note> That is, as he ſaith to Euoptius: <hi>That we muſt not handle or deale with that which is not gotten but by pure and onely faith, according to the conceipts of mans braine: That the bodie of our Lord is not common, although the nature of the diuine word bee not eaten: That the participation of this misterie, is a true confeſsion and remembrance, that the Lord is dead for the loue of vs, and that he is riſen againe for vs, and that by occaſion thereof, he filleth vs with his diuine bleſsings: Finally, that the operation of the Sacrament, is not wrought in the bread,

               <p>Theodoret,
<note place="margin">Theodor. dial. 1.</note> who was preſent at the Councel of Epheſus and Chalcedon, decideth this queſtion, dealing againſt the Eutichians, ſaying: <hi>Our Lord giuing the misteries, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bread, body, and the wine wherein the ſop had beene dipped, bloud.</hi> Then the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe brought in, in that Dialogue yeeldeth a reaſon to the Erraniſt, that is, to him that diſputed with him and maintained the errour, ſaying: <hi>Verily hee chaunged the names, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the body the name of the ſigne, and to the ſigne the name of the body. And that in the ſame manner that he called himſelfe a Vine; he called the ſigne bloud.</hi> And againe hee giueth the reaſon: <hi>To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they which are partakers of the diuine miſteries, doe not rest themſelues vppon the nature of things which are ſeene, but that becauſe of the chaunge of the names, they belieue the chaunge, which is wrought by grace.

They obiect vnto vs, that it is there ſaid: <hi>That Chriſt is preſent there, That he is there toucht with the hand, and ſeene with the eye, &amp;c.</hi> And would they haue all this vnderſtood according to the letter? How then is it ſaid both before and all with one breath; <hi>Christ is there inuiſiblie: It is not incident for him to bee diſcerned there by our ſight? &amp;c.</hi> And how will theſe contradictions in one &amp; the ſame Periode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree &amp; ſtand together; but only thus, by vnderſtanding the ſigne to be ſpoken of in the one, &amp; the thing in the other? Can they any way relieue themſelues ſtill holding their opinions, without falling as ſaith the Canon, into greater &amp; more dangerous hereſies then euer did Berengarius? But verily Chryſoſt. hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus elſwhere, <hi>Chriſt is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified before your eyes, his bloud runneth downe from his ſide, &amp;c.</hi> And S.

               <p>And ſurely, let vs further adde this one thing: That if the Fathers had had any ſuch opinion, they would not haue vſed that which remained of the Sacrament in ſuch ſort, as wee reade they did. Their pretended Clement I. ſaith: <hi>After that euerte man hath taken it, the Deacons ſet vp the rest and carrie it, in paſtophoria, that is to ſay, into the Miniſters their lodgings or Chambers.</hi> And thus alſo it is called by Apuleius and Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, in the deſcription of the Temple of Serapie, &amp;c. Thinke with your ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poore Chriſtian Martyrs in the time of Nero, had had any leaſure as then, once to dreame of this goodly frame and workmanſhip? Origen; <hi>The Lord ſaid vnto his Diſciples of the bread that he gaue them: Take, eate, he did not poſt them ouer to eate of the ſame afterward, neither did he commaund them that it ſhould bee kept vnto the next morning.</hi> Saint ierome; <hi>After the Communion, they that did eate the ſupper together in the Church, did make an end of all that which was remaining of the ſacrifices.</hi> So that out of that ſacred vſe, they did eate it as common bread. Heſychius; <hi>We ſee how they vſe to burne in the Church, all that which is not conſumed.</hi> According to Euagrius and Nicephorus: <hi>They were giuen to the little children, that were in the Schooles, to cate them the ſame hower.</hi> And the Councell of Maſcon, II. haue ordained and decreed that it ſhould be ſo. That of Tours, about the yeare 813. held vnder Charlemaine, addeth thereto: <hi>That it be done with diſcretion.</hi> Likewiſe Cardinall Humbert a Burgundian writing againſt Nicetus, <hi>Blameth the Greekes, for that they did not burne it.</hi> But it is for certaine, that it was not kept, eleuated, or ſhut vp cloſe in a boxe, to be worſhipped of the people. We reade rather that it was ſent to the ſicke, and ſuch as were abſent: that Biſhops in token of their Chriſtian vnitie, and that they were all one bread, did mutually ſend this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bread,
<note place="margin">Concil. Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. c. 14.</note> one to an other, &amp;c. The Pariſhes likewiſe at Eaſter, one to an other. Which thing was forbidden in the Councell of Laodicea, Can. 14. And therefore, there was but a little kept, becauſe that in the feruent zeale of thoſe times, the holy ſupper was celebrated almoſt euerie day: and that a great deale leſſe, then the water of the Fonts, which for all that was neither tranſubſtantiated, nor worſhipped. And this was the cuſtome of the Church. Some of ſuperſtition carried it into their houſes; and ſome women would wrap it vp in their handkerchefs, lockt it vp in their Coffers, and eate it at their owne houſes, &amp;c. Now let men iudge, if the firſt ages of the Church did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer take the Sacrament to be God; if it would haue ſuffered theſe prophanations? But theſe examples are worthie to be as much accompted of in the Church, as theirs that vſed to put it in childrens mouthes, abuſing this place: <hi>If any man eate my fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> or of others, who would put it in the mouthes of thoſe that were dead, &amp;c. being practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that haue beene condemned by many Councels.

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:15548:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>tradition, euen ſince the time of Tertullian and S. Cyprian, as alſo by the ordinance of Charlemaine: <hi>That the Miniſters ſhould haue the Euchariſt conſecrated euerte day,
<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 161.</note> for children:</hi> Becauſe they had no other ſtaie or foundation, then the Scripture miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The cuſtome likewiſe being, not of keeping it, but of giuing it to them which were in extremitie, grew hereupon, that many ſinking and ſhrinking away vnder the heate of perſecution, they were excluded and put from the Sacraments, by the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of this firſt diſcipline, and that euen to the hower of death, whereto the famous ſtorie of Serapio is to bee referred: And then that they might be comforted, by their being receiued into the peace and Communion of the Church, hauing giuen tokens of repentaunce; the Miniſters of the Church accompanied with their friendes, did communicate vnto them the holy Supper, and oftentimes alſo did communicate with them.</p>

Now it is a freſh to bee ſet before our eyes, that the firſt zeale of Chriſtendome beeing decaied and dead: Chriſtians came but fewe and ſeldome, to the receiuing of the holy Sacrament, in ſo much as that we haue heard thoſe good Fathers complaining of the ſame in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and forced to implore and craue the aide and authoritie of the Emperours, whoſe Lawes to that effect are extant with vs: <hi>That euerie perſon ſhould communicate eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Sabboth, after that at the leaſt thriſe a yeare, vpon paine of not being held any more for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> The Miniſters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feared, that their offerings, which were at that time their principall ſtaie and maintenance, (for there were not as yet any perſonages, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Maſſes, or priuate ſeruices) ſhould come to be dried vp, were conſtrained, as we haue ſeene, to teach the people, that although they communicated not, it wold not faile to yeeld them great aduantage &amp; furtherance to the ſaluation of their ſoules, if they would but onely bee preſent at their ſeruice: And the more eaſie to perſwade them the ſame, as wee ſay before, they did ſuggeſt into them by little and little: That there was not handled a Sacrament onely, but alſo a ſacrifice: So that though they did not communicate in the one, yet at the leaſt they were partakers in the other. A doctrine plauſibly imbraced of the moſt part of thoſe, which had learned the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the trying and proouing of themſelues, which is required in the receiuing of the Lords ſupper; not comming to the ſame, but with feare and trembling: and which on the contrarie did ſee, that there was nothing more eaſie, then to bee preſent at this pretended ſacrifice, the profit whereof was ſo highly commended to them, and alſo vnderpropt, as we haue ſeene heretofore, by the Lawes of the Emperours. And to make the ſame to be the more reuerently thought of, they applie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the more freely to deceiue, (the preſent age being now ouer-ſhadowed with ignorance, and the people brought to entertaine a ſeruice which was done altogether in an vnknowne language: by meanes of the alteration of languages, which hapned almoſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al Chriſtendome:) with diuers diſcourſes and ſundrie ſpeeches taken out of thoſe godly Fathers: a thing vnpoſsible for any man to haue effected in their time, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being then ſeaſoned with the doctrine of Chriſt, by the reading of the Scriptures; the preaching of good Biſhops: the frequenting of their Sermons, and the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeruice, which euerie where was done, according to the rule of the Apoſtle, in the vulgar tongue. And yet wee are not to imagine, that this monſter was perfected by ſuch increaſe and growth all at once.

               <p>Now in the life time of Charles the great, Iohannes Eryngerus, Scotus, a Monke of the order of Saint Bennet, companion to Alcuinus, and Schoolemaſter to Charles the great, had written a booke of the holy Supper, wherein hee dealeth againſt this abuſe, touching it, euen from the conception thereof: a certaine argument and proofe of that which the worthie Beda had taught, for as much as hee was his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The occaſion of which my ſpeech ariſeth vpon certaine places in Beda his works, which ſome haue corrupted; in like manner vpon Saint Mathew, which Auentinus witneſſeth that he found out, by comparing together the old Copies, which are kept in the auncient Monaſteries of Germanie,

And his reſolution, which hee gaue to King Charles, debated and argued from the teſtimonies of all the old writers, it was this in ſumme:
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That the Fathers vnder the Law in their Sacraments, did eate the fleſh, and drinke the bloud of Chriſt, as wee doe: That the eating in the holy ſupper is accompliſhed after the ſame way and maner, that regeneration in Baptiſme: that the viſible elements are Sacraments, ſignes, mysteries, and ſimilitudes or reſemblances, which are taken by the mouth and hand: That the inuiſible things, that is, the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, are receiued into the ſoule, and taken by faith: That the ſanctified Elements continue and abide ſtill in their firſt ſubſtance, and yet exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite vnto vs, by the inſtitution of the Lord, that which hee hath promiſed by his word: The fruit whereof is, to be ioyned to Chriſt, and made fellow ſufferers with him in his ſufferings, the image and remembrance whereof is celebrated in this myſterie.</hi> I would intreate the Reader, not
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:15548:251"/>not to grieue to reade this book, becauſe it is learned, and ſetteth forth in verie liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort, the opinions of the Fathers: preſsing and vrging the places of Scripture, and of the fathers; and as it were foreſeeing all the cauils of the maſters of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.

<note place="margin">Index. pag. 11</note> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it containeth to their diſlike, ſhould bee either chaunged or quite raced out: that is to ſay, the greateſt part of the booke.

There appeared Berengarius, who declared vnto them: <hi>That he did not teach bare and naked ſignes in the Euchariſt, but that the bread and wine there vſed, were moſt vndoubted pledges and ſeales of the reall Communion in the true bodie and bloud of our Lord, which all thoſe haue, and, there receiue which take theſe ſignes with a true faith: That the bread and wine notwithſtanding doe not chaunge their ſubstances: but rather, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones are made holy ones, of elements, Sacraments, &amp;c. And that to conclude, hee held for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, as all the auncient Fathers haue written, and according alſo to the ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lithurgie ordinarily read in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Councell reſted ſatisfied at his hands.</p>
               <p>But Pope Nicholas II. perceiuing that this doctrine was on foote againe, cited Berengarius to Rome the ſecond time, to appeare in the Conſiſtorie of Lateran, and thither hee came being drawne and allured by faire and flattering ſpeeches. The firſt argument that was framed againſt him, was, that if he did not retract his former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he ſhould be burnt: and thereupon Humbert the Burgonian, afterward Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, drew a reuocation, ſuch as we reade in the Decree: <hi>That hee doth confeſſe,
<note place="margin">C. Ego Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. de conſec. d. 2.</note> that after the Conſecration, the bread and wine, are the verie bodie and bloud of Christ: That they are there ſenſibly and in truth handled with the hands of the Prieſts: broken and bruſed with the teeth of the faithfull, &amp;c. And that hee curſeth all them which doe iudge otherwiſe, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, the whole Romiſh Church at this day, which holdeth theſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for hereticall: <hi>That the bread is the bodie, that the bodie is bruſed with the teeth, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lanfranc. de Sacr. &amp; Alger.</note> Where it is alſo to be noted, that he ſaith: <hi>Of the faithfull,</hi> not, <hi>of all thoſe that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof:</hi> a remnant and ſmall parcell of the pure doctrine, and a ſigne of the as yet imperfect deliuerie and teaching of the impure and corrupt. And therefore the Gloſe of the Decree addeth thereunto: <hi>Beware, leaſt thou ſhouldeſt not rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which Berengarius ſaith here, and ſo ſhouldeſt fall into greater and more groſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, then euer he did:</hi> And the Gloſe vpon the Canon, <hi>Vtrum,</hi> hath theſe words:

                  <hi>It is not lawfull to eate Chriſt with the teeth: Berengarius</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſaid the contrarie, but hee ſpoke hyberbolically, and went beyond the liſtes of the truth.</hi> And by conſequent, Pope Nicholas and the Councel of Rome, conſiſting of 114.

In the meane time this goodly recantation is ſent throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and Prouinciall Synods aſſembled in euerie nation, to cauſe it to be receiued. But Berengarius returneth into Fraunce, refuſeth it, and publiſheth the cruell and violent dealing wherewith he had beene tormented by <hi>the Church</hi> (as hee calleth it) <hi>of the malignant,

In the end Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius died in Fraunce: the fierie and terrible threatnings of the Pope, according to his former practiſe, ſtill perſeuering: And he had an Epitaph made him by Hildebert, or Fuldebert Biſhop of Mans,

Some adde, that dying hee ſhould ſay: <hi>To day Christ will appeare vnto me, according to my penitentneſſe, as I hope vnto glorie, or becauſe of others vnto paine.</hi> The moſt ſound interpretation whereof is, that he did repent of hauing yeelded or turned aſide from the profeſsion of the truth, and that he feared that he had offended his brethren through his infirmities.

In briefe, vpon the queſtion alſo of tranſubſtantiation; If the bodie of Chriſt, after the words ſpoken muſt be ſought for in heauen, or in the hands of the prieſt: and if of the wine &amp; bread there be nothing remaining but the Accidents: <hi>Christ</hi> (ſay the Canons) <hi>is in heauen vntil this world ſhall be conſummate and finiſhed. The bodie of Chriſt muſt be in one place, but the truth is spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad euerie where.</hi> And as for the kinds: <hi>Wee muſt not offer any other thing in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then wine, water, and bread, which are bleſſed in the figure of Chriſt: Before the bleſſing one kind is named, but after the bleſſing the bodie is ſignified. The bread and cuppe are a nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the reſurrection, by the myſticall conſecration, that is, by the efficacie of the worde and inſtitution of Chriſt.</hi> That is, ſaith the Gloſe: <hi>A ſpirituall refreſhing of the ſoule, which ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs vp againe from the death of ſinne.</hi> Againe, <hi>The bread and the cup</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>continue the thing that they are: &amp; yet notwithſtanding they are turned into another thing.</hi> Note, <hi>They continue the thing that they are.</hi> And he expoundeth it by way of conſequence: <hi>For as thou haſt taken the ſimilitude of death, ſo alſo doſt thou drinke the ſimilitude of bloud.</hi> Then not the bodie reallie, nor the bloud. But the Gloſe ſaith, <hi>In as much as they ſignifie them.</hi> In briefe, <hi>The ſacrifice of the Church conſiſteth in the Sacrament, and the thing of the Sacrament,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:15548:255"/>as Chriſt conſiſteth of God and man,
<note place="margin">Conſtat ex Deo &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note> &amp;c. Seeing that euerie thing containeth the nature and truth of thoſe things whereof it is made.</hi> Now then reaſon thus: Chriſt to bee God, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be man: neither therefore the bread and wine to be bread and wine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they bee Sacraments. And thus you may ſee how by the decree it ſelfe, made by Gratian the Monke, and authoriſed by the Popes; there cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to Peter Lombard,
<note place="margin">Lombard.</note> commonly called the Maiſter of the Sentences: How oft is he troubled to ſhift himſelfe of the fathers? And ſo much the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he would needes broach his owne opinion; whereas Gratian for the moſt parte contented himſelfe to report what other men thought. To the ende therefore that he may eſtabliſh the receiued opinion of his time, he cutteth off by the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Idem l. 1. d. 2.</note> that which the firſt and ancient ages had embraced and allowed: concealing &amp; keeping backe ſuch parte of that which he alleadged out of the fathers, as might hurt him;
<note place="margin">Auguſt in pſal. 73.</note> not making mention of any thing, as farre as in him lay, ſaue that which hee thought might ſerue his turne. Firſt, S. Auguſtine had ſaid in a hundred places, after S. Paule; That the Fathers vnder the law had eaten in their Sacraments the ſame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate that we doe eate in ours: <hi>He teacheth that thoſe did onely ſignifie and ſhadow out ſaluation, but that theſe do giue it:</hi> alleadging a lame and maimed place out of Saint Auguſtine, which he ordinarily expoundeth by theſe words: <hi>That they were Sacraments of Chriſt to come, and ours of Chriſt alreadie come, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, S. Auguſtine after Saint Paule hath taught vs; That we put on Chriſt in Baptiſme; That therein wee are made partakers alſo of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt: And all the fathers were wont to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Baptiſme, to the holy Supper; from the water, to the bread and wine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the power of the holy Ghoſt alike in the one and in the other: Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard perceiuing how this might ſeeme preiudiciall vnto him in the pretended tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, more ſparingly and pinchingly; <hi>Baptiſme</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>waſheth vs: the Euchariſt doth perfect vs in goodneſſe,
<note place="margin">Lombard. l. 4. d. 3.</note> &amp;c.</hi> euen ſo farre, as that he letteth not to preferre and ſet confirmation before it: Thirdly, the Fathers had not acknowledged in the Sacrament, any thing beſides the ſigne, and the thing of the Sacrament in the holy Supper, namely, the bread and wine ſanctified for ſignes, and the bodie and bloud for the thinges. Now Lombard againſt the nature of a Sacrament, acknowledged in all other Sacraments, to lay the foundation for his tranſubſtantiation, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth therein a double ſigne, and a double thing. The double ſigne, <hi>The kinds which he calleth bread and wine before the conſecration:</hi> And after the ſame, <hi>The inuiſible bodie and blood, ſignes of the viſible bodie and bloud of our Lord:</hi> And for the double ſignes: <hi>One contained and ſignified: that is, the fleſh of Chriſt, which he tooke of the virgine, and the bloud which he did ſhed for vs: and another not contained, and notwithſtanding ſignified, the vnitie of the Church, and the coniunction thereof with Chriſt, which hee calleth the myſticall fleſh of Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. Non hoc. C.

Ambroſe in ſpeciall: <hi>After the conſecration they are the ſame that they were,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lombard. l. 4. d. 8.</note> Lombard ſubtillie, <hi>They retaine the names of that which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:</hi> Contrarie to the Canons, <hi>Non oportet: In Sacrament.

<note place="margin">De conſecr. d. 2</note> &amp; rem Sacramenti, the ſigne and the thing:</hi> the vnbelieuers the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament onely: He then that maketh a double ſigne &amp; a double thing, &amp; the thing which he calleth contained and ſignified, a ſigne after the conſecration of the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and not contained, that is to ſay, the bodie and bloud of Chriſt inuiſible, vnder the appearances of bread and wine, ſignes of the viſible and ſenſible bodie of Chriſt, teacheth, as it were by the ſpirit of contradiction, <hi>That the wicked eate the thing of the Sacrament, and not the Sacrament.</hi> They eate not the Sacrament: (ſo did the Fathers call the bread and the wine:) for according to Lombard, there remaineth nothing but Accidents, which are not ſubiect to the teeth: And notwithſtanding our Lord hath
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:15548:255"/>ſaid, <hi>Take, eate.</hi> And the Apoſtle. <hi>He that ſhall eate of this bread, &amp;c.</hi> And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if we beleeue him, they eate the inuiſible bodie and bloud of Chriſt, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being partakers of the viſible bodie and bloud, whereof it is the ſigne: Againſt the Canons, <hi>Qui diſcordat, Chriſtus: Qui mandacant, &amp;c.</hi> And that which is worſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sonne of God himſelfe, who ſaith vnto vs; <hi>He that eateth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my bloud, he dwelleth in me, and I in him, he hath eternall life, &amp;c. Take this for remiſsion of your ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas certainly he doth not diſtinguiſh by inuiſible and viſible: And againſt the true Diuinitie alſo, which teacheth vs; <hi>That the fleſh and bloud of the Sonne of God are not without his ſoule, without his ſpirit, or without his diuinitie.</hi> Neither then without eternall life, or without nouriſhment to them that receiue him, and that vnto life, &amp; to the reſurrection vnto life. And this is it that Lombard ſaith in theſe words,
<note place="margin">Lombard. l. 4. d. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The wicked receiue ſacramentallie, that is to ſay, vnder the ſacrament, that is to ſay, vnder the viſible kind, the fleſh of Christ, taken of the virgine, &amp;c. but not the myſticall, which is not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of any but the good:</hi> that is to ſay, the vnitie which is betwixt Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: that which they call the proper and naturall bodie: this the ſpirituall bodie: whereas the old Church did neuer know in our Lord any moe bodies then one: and that a verie, true, and naturall bodie. And alſo he hath not a little to doe to cleare &amp; quite himſelfe of Saint Auguſtine, yea and when he hath done his beſt, yet hee ſeeth not how to ſhift him off, but by falſifying and corrupting of him. Sixthly, The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer acknowledged after the ſanctifying of the kindes any moe changes of names then one: as the giuing of the name of the thing vnto the ſigne: and they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe ſubſtances by the name of <hi>kindes,</hi> both before and after: Lombard vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth by kinds, <hi>The accidents onely, as whiteneſſe, taſte, weight, &amp;c.</hi> He diſputeth, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this change be formall or ſubſtantiall.</hi> In the beginning he ſaith, <hi>That he cannot decide the queſtion:</hi> Afterward he is more bold, <hi>Affirming reſolutely, that it is not formall, for the qualities ſtill remaine.</hi> And can theſe qualities remaine without matter? Some ſay, <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall,</hi> that is to ſay, that the ſubſtance of the bread, is turned into the bodie. <hi>And what then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould the fleſh of Chriſt grow and increaſe continually?</hi> Others, That the bodie and bloud doe take the place of the ſubſtances of bread and wine. <hi>And what becommeth then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the ſubstances of bread and wine? Doe they paſſe into the matter lying there in open ſight, or do they vaniſh into nothing? &amp;c.</hi> Others, That the one and the other abide together, the one for the ſigne, the other for the thing. Now there is not any one of theſe queſtions to bee found in the Fathers, as neither thoſe which follow: <hi>What foundation the Accidents doe reſt vpon: vpon ſome ſubiect,
<note place="margin">Idem l. 4. d. 12.</note> or without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubiect: whether the bodie and bloud do there take their forme, or whether our Lord be ſuch a one there, as he ſhall appeare in iudgement?</hi> Whereto for a concluſion Lombard addeth this: <hi>Whether he be there broken in deed, or ſeeme onely ſo to be? &amp;c.</hi> And here againe hee is in a foule puſſle, how to ridde himſelfe of the Canon, <hi>Ego Berengarius:</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee concludeth on the contrarie: <hi>That there is not any thing but the ſhew, that is to ſay, the ſimilitude or apparance, broken, &amp;c.</hi> Now thus many opinions and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and yet notwithſtanding vncondemned, being left as problemes and free for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one, doe proue vnto vs, that theſe good men were not as yet perſwaded to what ſide to bend, and that this doctrine was yet but verie new and raw to the Church. For if it had had any long ſtanding: who doubteth but that ſo many worthy perſonages, during ſo many ages, would haue become reſolued and reſolute long before? But it is about this matter that all the ſchoolemen doe buſie themſelues from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſome of them taking the one ſide, and others the other, vntill the time of the Councell held at Lateran, wherein the queſtion was decided: though afterward they could not reſt reſolued, ſo many were the doubts and ſcruples that croſſed that vaine and idle viſion. In the meane time it happeneth that Lombard ſhould make a ſcope, and ſay, <hi>That Chriſt is not ſacrificed or offered in the Maſſe in effect and in deed, but in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: And that the Maſſe is not properly a ſacrifice, but a repreſentation and remembrance of of a ſacrifice.</hi> Let vs reaſon thereupon; If he be there, then there alſo is a ſacrifice, yea there is a reall ſacrifice: but if there bee no reall ſacrifice, if there bee nothing made
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:15548:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>but a remembrance, then is there no hoſt offered, nor yet the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, reallie in the hoſt.</p>

And Bellarmine doth affirme and denie both together. Againe, ſometimes vrged out of Tertullian and Saint Auguſtine, they acknowledge that there is a figure, and ſometimes they doe wholly and flatly denie it, &amp;c. And they ſpeake as vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the chaunge and tranſmutation.

Againe, ſometimes they ſay: <hi>We ſet our teeth in the fleſh of our Lord, wee deuour and feede vpon him with our teeth, &amp;c. We chew him, wee breake him, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>Now wee haue finiſhed the whole hiſtorie of the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation taught in the Church of Rome:
<note place="margin">The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupper and the Maſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> But how farre is it off from the auncient ſimplicitie of the Chriſtian Church: and how farre from the inſtitution made by our Lord, of the holy ſupper? The Summe wherof is thus: That in the holy ſupper we are ſeriouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of our bond and obligation vnto our Lord; and of our dutie towards our neighbour: likewiſe nouriſhed and ſtrengthned in our coniunction with Chriſt our head; whereupon dependeth our true life, which approueth and maketh it ſelf mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly knowne, (as the ſoule doth it ſelfe by his motions) by our zeale towards God, and our behauiour towards our neighbours. Therein we cal to mind our obligation,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:15548:261"/>when we remember according to his commandement, the death and Paſsion of our Lord: That we were dead in our ſinnes, dead verily and eternally; ſeeing it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſarie, that the eternall Sonne of God ſhould expoſe and giue himſelfe to death, euen to the death of the Croſſe, to redeeme and ſet vs free from that death: therefore eternall death. And thence is that action of praiſe and thankeſgiuing that followeth, ſolemnely obſerued and performed in this action, and perpetuall in our ſoules, if we be truely faithfull: For hee that willingly belieueth this great and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefit, how can he poſsibly forget it? How can it poſsibly be, but that he ſhould occupie and as it were powre forth himſelfe in a continuall exerciſing of praiſe and thankeſgiuing? Seeing I ſay, he ſinneth euerie moment, he cannot bee without matter to humble himſelfe euerie moment, and to haue his eye both vpon death and alſo vpon hell; and accordingly againe he hath matter euerie moment to raiſe vp him ſelfe againe in hope, by the remembrance of this eternall Sacrifice, vpon the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is made, namely in this Sacrament: How that the Sonne of God hath giuen his bodie for him, hath beene broken with cares and griefes; and how that his bloud was ſhed for the remiſsion of his ſinnes. And this is the cauſe why this Sacrament is called, both a remembrance and an Euchariſt, or action of thankeſgiuing: For of the remembraunce of this benefite, of this gift of ſaluation (and by this vnſpeakable meanes) there followeth in euerie Chriſtan heart, a ſerious and heartie Euchariſt or thankeſgiuing. But this effect by name, is wanting in the Papiſts their Maſſe: For this remembrance is not practiſed in it at all: the death of the Lord is not ſhewed foorth there at all vnto the people: This is, in ſteed of whatſoeuer it ſhould bee, a heape of words, and a varietie of geſtures, neither the one nor the other vnderſtood. Wee are taught likewiſe in the holy Supper, our duties towards our neighbours: for wee are not only created of one and the ſame Maſſe; but regenerate and begotten again, but redeemed and bought with one price, euen bloud; but made members of the ſame bodie: and quickned by one and the ſame ſpirit, but liuing, mouing, and feeling, from one and the ſame head: One with him, through the grace of his good pleaſure and will: One therefore amongſt our ſelues, both by his commaundement, and by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dutie. And if the head, the eternall Sonne of God, haue giuen his life for vs, to make vs I ſay, his members: what do there members owe, yea what doe they not owe one to an other? Seeing alſo, that this head moſt liuely feeling all that which theſe members doe or ſuffer, doe not diſdaine to declare and manifeſt vnto vs: that what is done or denied vnto the leaſt, is done or denied vnto himſelfe, and from him hath either reward or puniſhment? And this is the cauſe why the Fathers haue called it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>an aſſemblie, a Communion:</hi> And this ſecond fruit and effect is alſo wanting in the Maſſe; where there is no Communion betwixt the members, nor any ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this coniunction of Chriſt with vs, of our ſelues together, all men vſing of ſo many cornes to make but one Loafe and one wine; and al of vs ſucking life out of the ſame death: nouriſhment from the ſame meate, of the fleſhe and bloud of our Lord: But particularly, in reſpect of our ſelues, we being members of Chriſt, and quickned by Chriſt, are there nouriſhed and ſtrengthned both in Chriſt and of Chriſt. And it is not more ſure, that the Miniſter doth giue vs the bread and wine, that wee take them with our hands, that we eate and drinke them, that they are conuerted into our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and become nouriſhment for our bodies, to maintaine and ſtrengthen this life, then it ought to be ſure and certaine to euerie Chriſtian, that our Lord in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper celebrated according to his inſtitution, dooth giue vnto vs at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, his fleſh and bloud: That we take them by faith, that we eate and drinke them, that they are turned into the life and ſubſtance of our ſoules, becomming the foode of the ſame, to maintaine and ſtrengthen vs vnto eternall life. Yea, and which more is, that by the predominant and ouer-ruling power that they haue, they turne our ſoules both to Chriſt, and into Chriſt, vniting them vnto him, and making them one with him: and our bodies, conſequently and proportionablie after the manner of our ſoules, doe make vs bones of his bones, fleſh of his fleſh, members of that head,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:15548:262"/>gouerned by his ſpirit: and one with him; to raiſe againe one day our bodies and ſoules: to be glorified and raigne with him. And this fruit alſo of the holy Supper is lacking in the Maſſe of the Church of Rome, wherein there is not any thing at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting this ſtraite and neere coniunction with Chriſt, or that true eating, by the which it is cheriſhed and maintained, wherein ſuch as are preſent, doe neither eate nor drinke corporally nor ſpiritually, wherein they become all together idle gaſers and ſtarers vpon the Prieſt, which eateth and drinketh, and vpon a pretended myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie both deafe and dumbe: and wherein, in a word, there is not any one action, which ſtirreth vp their conſciences, nor any manner of inſtruction to helpe forward and ad vnto their knowledge.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principall ends, for which our Lord inſtituted his holy Supper, and whereof wee haue beene altogether deſtitute vnder the Church of Rome, which in ſteed of this ſacred meate, which we were wont to eate at our Fathers table, hath fed vs with huskes, apiſh toyes and mummeries: intertaining in ſtead of all that which was the old faſhion of Rome, the poore people, with vaine pompes and ceremonies; and therefore famiſhed with the want of the grace of God. From that farre countrie, whether our humane fancies had tranſported and led vs, wee are put in mind of our Fathers table, and become reſolued to returne againe home vnto him; from theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes and deceits, ſo farre differing from his inſtitution, to his truth; and from our ſinnes to his grace, and that by his grace. <hi>Father</hi> (haue we ſaid) <hi>We haue ſinned againſt heauen, and againſt thee: we are not worthie any more to be called thy children.</hi> And hee hath according to the ſame, euen his wonted mercie, put a ring vpon our finger, cloathed vs with Chriſt, and cauſed vs to eate his fleſh and his bloud. <hi>They were dead</hi> (hath hee ſaid) <hi>but they are returned to life: they were loſt, and they are found againe, &amp;c.</hi> To God bee praiſe and glorie for euer, by the ſame his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen. Let vs now runne ouer and briefely rehearſe againe, all that which we haue handled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of in this whole worke.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Booke we haue handled the rearing and raiſing vp of the Maſſe,
<note place="margin">A briefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of the whole worke.</note> from time to time, and from parcel to parcell: we haue ſhewed that the old ſeruice did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a publike confeſsion of ſinnes, in the reading of the old &amp; new Teſtament, and that of whole bookes of the ſame, in ſinging of Pſalmes by the whole Congregation, in a Sermon vnto the people, which was made by the Biſhop or Paſtor, expounding either ſome place, that had beene read, or ſome ſuch other as hee iudged fit for the edifying of the Church: in offerings, which were offered by the people for the poore and other vſes of the ſame: in a generall praier, for all the neceſsities of the Church &amp; ſtate: in the inſtitution of the holy Supper, taken out of the Goſpell, or the Apoſtle: in a witneſsing of the ſincere loue of the faithfull, one towards an other, before they ſhould draw neere vnto the holy Table: and in a denunciation vnto ſuch as were not of this number, to the wiſhing of them to abſtaine: in the diſtribution of the holy Supper, vnto all the people, vnder both kindes: during the time of which action, they ceaſed not to ſing Pſalmes, or to read the Scriptures: and finally in a ſolemne thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for the benefit receiued, as well in the death and Paſsion of our Lord, as in the Communion of his body and bloud in the holy ſupper. Which done, the Biſhop or Paſtor ſent the people away with a holy bleſsing. And it is not to be forgotten, as we haue ſeene, that all this was done in an vnderſtood and knowne tongue. As for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead, praying vnto Saints, the Canon of the pretended ſacrifice, and all the parts whereof it is framed, wee haue ſeene them brought in many ages after, and that at ſeuerall times, and great diſtaunces betwixt one and an other, and ſtill impairing and growing worſe from time to time. Retaining therfore, for our ſeruice, that which we well perceiue to bee truely auncient, and reiecting that which is notoriouſly new: what ſhall ſuch ſeruice bee, to ſpeake according to a good conſcience, but the ſame, that is now vſed in the reformed Churches?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Booke, we haue compared the circumſtances of the old ſeruice, and thoſe of the Maſſe: Firſt, we haue found the Church vnder perſecution: without pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:15548:262"/>places, to call vpon the name of God in. Afterward wee did ſee Churches built for the ſame, but without any manner of Images, with tables (let vs call them if you will Altars) for the communicating of the holy ſupper: but without Lampes, burning of Incenſe, Conſecrations, Dedications, &amp;c. We haue obſerued the lawfull election and calling of the Biſhops vnto the holy Miniſterie, by taking due examination of their liues and doctrine; adminiſtring the word of God and the holy Sacraments in the vulgar tongue, heard and vnderſtood of euerie one, wearing ſuch apparell as was modeſt, but ordinarie, not tied vnto a ſingle life, but rather bound vnto an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie chaſtitie: not called Sacrificers, except in that they ſacrificed the Goſpell: and to ſay no more, without annoynting, or any other character or marke of the beaſt. All, whatſoeuer is more, was brought in a long time after, and by degrees; ſometimes by a fooliſh imitation of ſome point of Iudaiſme; and ſometime by the importunate cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Paganiſme; as namely, by Images, Altars, Lampes, burning of Incenſe, Vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Conſecrations, Dedications, whether it bee of liuing perſons, or things that are dead, vowes and characters; Barbariſme in ſeruice, and ſuch like things, &amp;c. Cutting off them, and caſting away this new deuice, and holding our ſelues to the olde, in all theſe circumſtances, of places, times, perſons, and all the reſt of that ſort, ſhall we not ſee that which the reformed Churches haue alleadged: namely, the ſeruice of God purged from Idolatrie, ſuperſtition, vanitie, and ſo many fooliſh ceremonies, and the Cleargie alſo, from all their pompe whether Iewiſh or Heathniſh, wherewith they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the ſilly vulgar ſort? Yea that more is, from that loathſome impuritie of life, which maketh them offenſiue, yea which maketh them to ſtincke throughout the whole world; and laſtly the people from being holden and kept vnder Barbariſme, ſottiſhneſſe and groſſe ignorance, namely, of their owne ſaluation, and that which is onely neceſſarie for them.</p>
               <p>In the third and fourth, wee haue intreated of the auncient doctrine of the holy Supper, comparing it with that of the Romiſh Maſſe. And firſt, as concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; it is manifeſtly ſhewed, that the Church did neuer either know or acknowledge any moe then one onely propitiatorie Sacrifice: euen Chriſt nailed vppon the Croſſe for our ſinnes, the remembrance whereof is commaunded in the holy Supper: for the which alſo, there are ſolemne actions of praiſe and thankfulneſſe performed in the ſame: That theſe Maſſes or Sacrifices, whether they be for the quicke or the dead, were not knowne amongſt the auncient writers, no nor yet Purgatorie it ſelfe, where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are founded: No more were the Sacrifices in the honour and inuocation of the Saints deceaſed, as vnto whome there was neither Adoration nor Inuocation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: whoſe merit alſo was neuer imployed by the Fathers: either for ranſome, or remedie for ſinnes, but that onely one of the alone mediatour, the Sonne of God our Lord. And as concerning the Sacrament: that the auncient Church followed therein the inſtitution of the Lord, in the ſimplicitie thereof: adminiſtred it vnto the faithful people, after the holy ſeruice, diſtributing vnto them the bread &amp; wine, aſſured pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſeales of the fleſh &amp; bloud of Chriſt, which they receiued at the ſame inſtant in a true faith, by the operation of the holy Ghoſt, vnto the nouriſhing of their ſoules, and their aſſurance of reſurrection vnto eternal life: not imagining notwithſtanding for all this, that there was any chaunge in the nature of the ſignes, but onely in their condition and vſe: And therefore it did not eleuate, worſhip, locke them vp, carrie them in proceſsion, or call them God, or Lord, &amp;c. as they vſe to doe at this day, and yet there raigned therein both more feruent zeale, and clearer knowledge. That all this on the contrarie is verie new, brought in not aboue three daies agoe, <hi>Heri aut Nudiuſtertius,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaketh, condemned of it ſelfe by the onely date of their inſtituting thereof, being in the times of moſt groſſe and palpable ignorance, ioyned with leſſe religiouſneſſe and greater ſtore of corruptions, then euer had haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Church of Rome before. Let vs then take away the propitiatorie Sacrifice and Tranſubſtantiation: and what remaineth but the Sacrifice of thankeſgiuing? The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of remembrance, and the Euchariſticall ſacrifice, which wee acknowledge in
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:15548:263"/>the holy Supper? As alſo that ſtraite and neere Communion which we haue therein by faith in our Lord, that we may be redeemed by his obedience, and liue by his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, to be one with him: and by conſequent, one with our brethren.</p>
               <p>And thus euerie thing deducted and rebated: noueltie renounced, and antiquitie embraced: we renounce and quite diſclaime the Maſſe of the Romiſh Church, but we moſt willingly and ioyfully receiue the Communion of the reformed Church. For that which is more in ſubſtance, we may ſpeake it with a good conſcience: either it is of the vanitie of man, or of the peruerſneſſe of the diuell. Might it therefore pleaſe God, for his holy mercies ſake, to open all our eyes to know his waies, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to moue our hearts, and to direct our feete to walke therein, and therein to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and goe forward: that ſo wee may eſcape the penaltie of the Lords ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with his owne mouth: <hi>If you were blind</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you ſhould haue no ſinne: He that knoweth his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> And to God Almightie, the onely author and ordainer both of Sacrifices and Sacraments: To Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, our onely Sacrificer and Sacrifice, our life and ſpirituall meate: and to the holy Ghoſt, the true inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of this life, and diſtributor of this nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bee honour, glorie and Empire for euer.
